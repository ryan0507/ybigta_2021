It is called Rohrau, and there, during the night of March\\n31, 1732, and descended from a long line of humble hand-toilers, was born\\nFranz Joseph Haydn, who was destined to make the family name immortal.\\nHis father, Mathias Haydn, was a master wheelwright, whose father, Thomas\\nHaydn, had followed the same occupation. The mother of Franz, or Joseph,\\nas he is now called, was Maria Koller, daughter of the market inspector\\nof the locality, and a cook in the household of Count Harrach, the lord\\nof the village. The ancestry of the Haydns is undistinguished as far back\\nas it can be traced. This union of the wheelwright and the cook resulted\\nin a family of twelve children, of whom three developed into musicians.\\nThey were Franz Joseph, the subject of this sketch, Johann Michael, the\\nchurch composer, and Johann Evangelist, a singer of no special excellence.\\nThere is no record of musical talent on the side of either the Haydns\\nor the Kollers previous to its appearance in the family of Mathias, and\\nits sudden development in three of the offspring of this marriage is\\ninexplicable.\\n\\nIn addition to his occupation as a wheelwright, Mathias Haydn officiated\\nas sexton of his parish. Both he and his wife were able to sing\\nsufficiently well to increase their scant earnings by singing in church on\\nSundays and holidays, and at fairs and festivals. They also indulged in\\nmusic at home, after a rude fashion, the father accompanying the voices on\\nthe harp, which he had learned to play by ear. The parents of the future\\ncomposer were hard-working people who feared God, and so thoroughly did\\nthey instill their religious feelings into their children, that Haydn\\nfelt the influence of this early discipline all through his long life. Of\\nhis earliest years but little is known except that, while yet a tender\\nchild, he began to manifest the musical instinct that was in him by\\nsinging the simple tunes that his father was able to strum on the harp,\\nand by exciting wonder at the correctness of his ear and his keen sense of\\nrhythm. These gifts, however, are by no means rare in children, and the\\npossession of them does not necessarily insure that their possessors shall\\ndevelop into Haydns and Mozarts.\\n\\nOne day a cousin, a certain Johann Mathias Frankh, who lived in Hainburg,\\npaid the Haydns a visit, and his attention was called to young Joseph\\'s\\nprecocious musical talent. Frankh was a school-master and a good musician,\\nand in Hainburg he filled the offices of Chorregent and Schulrector.\\nStruck by the talents of the boy, he proposed to take upon himself his\\neducation, musical and otherwise. The father eagerly accepted the offer,\\nbut the mother hesitated, for it was her ambition that the youngster\\nshould become a priest. Her objections, however, were overcome, and the\\nresult was that Haydn, when six years of age, left his home never to\\nreturn to it again as an inmate. Frankh took him to Hainburg, instructed\\nhim in reading and writing and in the rudiments of Latin. He also grounded\\nhim in the elements of music, taught him to sing, and to play the violin.\\nThe boy was an apt and zealous pupil, studied with unremitting industry\\nand progressed rapidly.\\n\\nFrankh was not a lenient teacher, nor was he very conscientious in his\\nduties at the head of his school. He was addicted to gambling, and his\\nhonesty was not above suspicion, for he was discharged from his position\\nfor cheating with loaded dice, though later he was reinstated. In common\\nwith the pedagogues of his time he was firm in the faith that what could\\nnot be learned easily could be beaten into a pupil; consequently blows\\nwere not lacking when the child proved dull of understanding, and a\\nlesson hesitatingly recited was followed by a vigorous thrashing, after\\nwhich the boy was sent to bed without his dinner. This severity, however,\\nwas not unkindly meant, for the pedagogue was equally fond and proud of\\nhis young charge, and the harshness was not without its good results, as\\nmay be inferred from the fact, that many years afterwards, Haydn spoke of\\nhis hard discipline, in which, according to his own words, he was given\\n\"more beating than bread,\" with the warmest gratitude. Not only this, but\\nin his will, Haydn bequeathed to Frankh\\'s daughter and her husband, one\\nhundred florins and a portrait of Frankh, \"my first music teacher.\"\\n\\nThis rough teaching, nevertheless, soon reached a point beyond which it\\nwas useless to persevere in it, for Frankh could flog no more knowledge\\nof music into the boy for the simple reason that he had imparted all\\nthat he possessed. Haydn was now eight years old and had been studying\\ntwo years with Frankh, when, one day, George Reuter, director of music\\nat the Cathedral of St. Stephen, in Vienna, visited Hainburg. He was on\\na tour having for its object the procuring of boy voices for his choir,\\nand meeting with Frankh, that worthy grew eloquent in the praise of his\\nprecocious pupil, and eagerly solicited Reuter to hear the youngster sing.\\nThe Capellmeister consented, and was astonished at the proficiency of the\\nboy and delighted with the sweetness of his voice. The outcome of the\\nhearing was that Reuter offered to take Haydn as one of the boy choir at\\nSt. Stephen\\'s and to look after his musical education; and so, in 1740,\\nHaydn bade farewell to his hard, but well meaning master, and went to\\nVienna. The parting was not without tears on both sides, and Haydn was\\nnever forgetful or unappreciative of the benefit he had received from\\nFrankh.\\n\\nAt St. Stephen\\'s an entirely new life opened to him. The school, an\\nancient foundation, consisted of a Cantor, a Subcantor, two ushers and\\nsix scholars. They dwelt under the same roof and ate together. The city\\npaid for the board, lodging and clothing of the scholars, but not too\\nliberally, and the youngsters were never under the doctor\\'s care for\\nover-eating and had no occasion to pride themselves on the quantity or\\nthe quality of the clothing given them. Reading, writing, arithmetic and\\nLatin were among the studies taught in addition to music. In the art to\\nwhich his life was now devoted, Haydn received instruction in singing and\\non the violin and clavier. Harmony and composition were also supposed to\\nbe taught by Reuter, but Haydn could never recall more than two lessons\\nin theory imparted to him by the Capellmeister. The boy was therefore\\nthrown on his own resources, for he had no money with which to pay for\\nlessons from other teachers. The music that he now heard opened a new\\nworld to him and filled him with an unappeasable desire to produce such\\nmusic himself. He was soon absorbed in every book on musical theory, to\\nwhich he had access, and he never put it aside before he had completely\\nmastered all that it had to tell him. In the meanwhile his attire became\\nshabbier and shabbier; his shoes were worn down at the heels, and his\\nappearance gradually merged into what he long afterwards described as\\nthat of \"a veritable little ragamuffin.\" He wrote home for money to renew\\nhis apparel, and when his father sent him six florins for that purpose he\\nbought Fux\\'s \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" and the \"Vollkommener Capellmeister,\"\\nby Mattheson. The former was his constant companion, and he even placed it\\nunder his pillow when he went to bed. When his companions were at play he\\nstudied, and when they were over noisy and disturbed him he would, as he\\nsaid many years later, \"take my little clavier under my arm and go away to\\npractise in quiet.\" Music had become his passion.\\n\\nBy and by he began to compose and was soon occupied in filling with notes\\nevery sheet of music paper that came within his reach; the more notes he\\nwas able to crowd on a page the more he was satisfied with himself, for\\nhe \"thought it must be right if the paper was sufficiently covered with\\nnotes.\" The determination and industry of the lad were extraordinary, and\\nhe very early began to illustrate that phase of genius which is a capacity\\nfor hard work. One of his first compositions was a \"Salve Regina\" for\\ntwelve voices. This was seen by Reuter, who dryly suggested that it would\\nperhaps be better to write it for two voices at first, and to learn how to\\nwrite music properly before he began to compose it; but he did not attempt\\nto show him how to do either. In fact, the boy had no other resource than\\nto rely on his own unaided efforts to acquire the knowledge for which he\\nso eagerly yearned, and hence, after his parting with Frankh he was wholly\\nself-taught. Such was his life until he became sixteen years old, when\\nhis prospects, already dark enough, were to become still more clouded,\\nfor his voice broke and he was no longer useful as a boy soprano. Reuter,\\nwho had no special regard for the lad, resolved to take advantage of the\\nearliest opportunity that offered, to dismiss him. Before this, however,\\nHaydn\\'s brother, Michael, had been accepted as a member of the choir, to\\nthe great delight of the former. His voice was more powerful and of better\\nquality than was Joseph\\'s, which gave indications of breaking. In fact, on\\none occasion the empress said that \"Joseph Haydn sang like a raven\" and\\nrequested that his brother might replace him. Michael was given a solo to\\nsing, and acquitted himself with so much tenderness and sweetness that the\\nempress sent for him and gave him twenty-four ducats. Reuter complimented\\nhim on his good luck and the honor that had been done him, and asked\\nhim what he was going to do with so large a sum. Michael replied: \"I\\nshall send half to my good father and keep the other half until my voice\\nbreaks,\" a resolution that Reuter approved warmly, and which he offered to\\nfurther by taking charge of the twelve ducats. Michael gave them to him,\\nbut when his voice broke at last, the ducats were not forthcoming, and he\\nnever saw them again.\\n\\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF JOSEPH HAYDEN IN ROHRAU.\\n\\nThe house still exists and is very little changed. The windows to the\\nright, the fence and the grass plot have disappeared. There is now a bench\\nunder the windows at the left, and a rudely executed tablet inserted in\\nthe wall.\\n\\nBeethoven, on his deathbed, showed this picture to Hummel, saying with\\ngreat emotion: \"See, dear Hummel, this is a present I received to-day and\\nit gives me a childish pleasure.\"]\\n\\nPresently Haydn\\'s doom was sealed. One day, in a spirit of mischief, he\\ncut off the pigtail of a fellow student and was sentenced by Reuter to be\\nwhipped on the hand with a cane. Haydn pleaded, wept, and remonstrated,\\nbut in vain; and at last he declared that he would sooner leave the\\ncathedral than suffer so humiliating and cruel an outrage. Reuter\\ncynically retorted that he had no objection to the alternative, \"but you\\nshall be caned just the same, and then you can pack off, bag and baggage\\nas soon as you see fit\"; and so Haydn was punished and then sent forth\\ninto the streets of Vienna without a penny and with attire so worn and\\ndirty that he was ashamed to be seen. The world was now before him and his\\noutlook was dreary and discouraging enough. He was friendless, without\\nprospects and did not know which way to turn to make either. He could\\nreturn to Rohrau, where he was sure of a warm and tender welcome from his\\nparents, but he would not burden their scanty means with his support, and\\nbesides, he had resolved to succeed by the talent that, from the first, he\\n\"knew was in him.\" His life at the school had inured him to privation and\\nhunger, and if he could only earn enough to keep soul and body together he\\nwould be content. His departure from his late home took place on a stormy\\nNovember evening, and he walked the streets all night hopelessly. Sunrise\\nfound him still wandering and ready to faint with hunger and fatigue.\\nUtter despair had seized on him when he chanced to meet with one Spangler,\\na chorister at St. Michael\\'s, whose acquaintance he had made some time\\nbefore. The singer found it hard to win enough bread for himself and his\\nwife and child, but he took pity on the unfortunate boy and offered him\\nthe shelter of the miserable attic in which he lived with his family.\\nHaydn gratefully accepted the kindness, and dwelt with his benefactor\\nthrough the winter, suffering, with him, cold and hunger. During this\\nsad time, the boy\\'s courage faltered for the first time and his natural\\nbuoyancy of spirits was dulled. He thought of finding some less precarious\\nmeans of earning enough to eat and drink and to clothe himself than music\\npresented, and for a moment he turned his back on the art he loved so\\nwell; but it was only for a moment. His instinct reasserted itself and\\nonce more he turned resolutely toward music, and never again did he falter\\nin his determination to devote himself heart and soul to it.\\n\\nIn his search for employment he was, now and then, fortunate enough to be\\nengaged to play the violin at dances and merrymakings. Then he obtained a\\nfew scholars who paid him the by no means munificent sum of two florins\\nper month. In the meantime he studied incessantly, especially the six\\nclavier sonatas of Emanuel Bach. With a rickety harpsichord for his\\ncompanion, he forgot his misery and the squalor of the garret in which\\nhe lived. About this time he met a good angel, a Vienna tradesman, by\\nname, Buchholz, who becoming interested in him, and sympathizing with the\\nmiserable poverty in which he struggled so cheerfully, loaned him one\\nhundred and fifty florins, taking no acknowledgment therefor and making no\\nconditions for repayment. It may be mentioned here that Haydn promptly\\nreturned the money when fortune smiled on him, and that he did not forget\\nthe kindness is evidenced by his first will, in which he left \"Jungfrau\\nAnna Buchholz one hundred florins, in remembrance that in my youth and\\nextreme need, her grandfather made me a loan of one hundred and fifty\\nflorins without interest which I faithfully repaid fifty years ago.\" This\\nmoney was a godsend, for it enabled him to procure a room of his own. The\\nnew apartment was not a great improvement on that which he had quitted.\\nIt was in the old \"Michaelerhaus\"; and was also a garret boarded off from\\na larger room. There was scarcely any light and the space was hardly more\\nthan would suffice for a fair-sized closet. The roof was in a neglected\\nstate, and when the weather was inclement the rain or snow would come\\nthrough and fall on the lodger\\'s bed. However, Haydn was happy and could\\nstudy and practice without interruption.\\n\\nCuriously enough, his selection of this room had a great influence on\\nhis future, for in the same house lived Metastasio in a style befitting\\nhis position. The poet was superintending the education of his host\\'s\\ntwo daughters. He soon began to take notice of the young man whom he\\nfrequently met on the stairs, and charmed with his character, sought his\\nacquaintance. Recognizing his talents and wishing to serve him, he taught\\nhim Italian, and after a time, entrusted to him the musical education\\nof one of the young girls, but now referred to. He added still further\\nto these services by introducing him to Porpora, then the greatest of\\nsinging-teachers, and one of the most eminent masters of composition.\\nBefore these friendships with Metastasio and Porpora began, however, Haydn\\nlived alone for a year and a half, supporting himself by teaching for\\nwhatever payment he could obtain; playing the violin whenever he could\\nearn even the smallest pittance, and obtaining such other engagements as\\nwould help him to buy food, and to pay for his room.\\n\\nHaydn gave his young pupil daily lessons on the clavier, and for his\\nservices he obtained free board for some three years. This pupil took\\nsinging lessons from Porpora, and it was Haydn\\'s good fortune to be\\ncalled to go with her to the master\\'s house to play her accompaniments.\\nIn order to win the good will of the surly and cynical old master, Haydn\\nperformed various menial offices for him, even brushed his clothes\\nand cleaned his shoes. The result was that the young man received some\\nvaluable instruction in composition, from time to time, together with much\\ncursing and more insults. Porpora had among his pupils the mistress of the\\nVenetian Ambassador, to whom he took Haydn in the office of accompanist.\\nThe Italian, not over generous with his own money, induced the Ambassador\\nto give Haydn a pension, and the consequences were that the struggling\\ncomposer was made richer by fifty francs a month, and was enabled to add\\nto the books he loved so well and studied so constantly.\\n\\nHaydn was now about twenty years of age, had suffered great privations\\nand had not been able to rise much above the position of a lackey; but he\\nnever relaxed in his devotion to his art. He submitted to degradations,\\nkicks and curses because it was not in his power to resent them. The\\nwonder of it all is that his misfortunes and his humiliations did not sour\\nhis temper irremediably, and that he should have remained buoyant and\\namiable to the end of his long life. His existence in his attic was gloomy\\nand poverty-stricken, but in his old age he told Carpani that he was\\nnever happier than he was in that bare and lowly room with his worm-eaten\\nclavier and his books.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOSEPH HAYDN.\\n\\nFrom the original pastel portrait by Anton Graff. The original is half\\nlife-size.]\\n\\nAt this period he had composed his first Mass in F, a work which, though\\ncrude and faulty, is remarkable as the effort of a self-taught genius.\\nBy this time, also, he had finished his first opera, \"Der Neue Krumme\\nTeufel,\" for which he was paid twenty-four ducats, but of which only the\\nlibretto is extant. It was produced at the Stadttheatre in 1752, and as it\\nwas also given in Prague, Berlin and other cities, it would appear that\\nit was successful. Judging by those operas by Haydn that have come down\\nto us, the disappearance of the score of his first work in that class is\\nnot to be greatly lamented. His muse was essentially undramatic, yet with\\nthat peculiar blindness to the true bent of his talents, a blindness far\\nfrom uncommon among men of genius, he entertained a firm faith that it was\\nhis mission to write operas. Fortunately his opportunities to indulge his\\nidiosyncrasy were not of a nature to enable him to turn from the path in\\nwhich he was to win fame, although he composed in addition to the opera\\nnamed, thirteen Italian and five Marionette operas, of which nothing has\\nsurvived or has deserved to survive. Haydn was destined to revolutionize\\ninstrumental music; but the man who was to revolutionize the opera was yet\\nto come and was to be called Mozart.\\n\\nAmong Haydn\\'s other compositions at this period were some clavier sonatas\\nwritten by him for his pupils. They were the fruits of his study of the\\nfirst six sonatas of C. Ph. Emanuel Bach, to which he devoted himself\\nuntiringly. Haydn said, \"I played them constantly and did not rest until\\nI had mastered them all, and those who know my music must also know that\\nI owe very much to Emanuel Bach.\" In fact Haydn prided himself greatly\\nbecause he had been once complimented by Bach for his knowledge of\\nthat composer\\'s works. One of these sonatas by Haydn had attracted the\\nattention of the Countess Thun, an enthusiastic amateur of music, who\\nexpressed a desire to see him. He called on her and surprised her by his\\nyouthful appearance and distressed her by the shabbiness of his attire.\\nThe evil fortune that always kept him in want during his early years was\\nagain accompanied by the good fortune that at every crucial stage of his\\nyouthful career brought him into contact with influential friends who\\nassisted him. The Countess questioned him about himself. In response to\\nher inquiries he gave her a straightforward account of his situation,\\non hearing which she presented him with twenty-five ducats and engaged\\nhim to give her lessons on the harpsichord and in singing. His prospects\\nbrightened, and as pupils began to increase in number he raised his charge\\nfor lessons from two to five florins ($2.50)--a month! An additional\\npiece of good fortune came to him at this stage of his prosperity in the\\nacquaintance of Baron Furnberg, a rich nobleman and an ardent and talented\\namateur, to whose house Haydn was invited. Here private concerts were\\ngiven, and the young composer heard frequent performances of string trios\\nand quartets, such as they were.\\n\\nOn the solicitation of Furnberg, Haydn composed his first quartet, and\\nseventeen other quartets followed within a year. The Countess Thun still\\nremained a warm friend and used all her influence for his advancement.\\nFurnberg, who appears to have been very fond of him, was no less eager\\nto push his fortunes. Through these two supporters he was introduced\\nto Count Ferdinand Maximilian Morzin, a Bohemian nobleman, immensely\\nrich and a great lover of music. He had an orchestra of some eighteen\\nperformers, which, when necessity demanded, was augmented by servants who\\nwere musicians. Through the solicitations of Furnberg, Morzin appointed\\nHaydn his Musikdirector and Kammercompositor, and in 1759, at the age\\nof twenty-seven, the composer began, what was up to that date, the most\\nimportant stage of his artistic career, and ended forever his painful and\\nuncertain toil for enough to eat from day to day. For twenty-one years\\nhe had struggled in misery, almost hopelessly, but without ever losing\\nwholly his faith in his future, and always buoyed up by his intense\\nlove for his art. When he entered on the duties of his new position it\\nis not unreasonable to believe that he looked back on his past, on the\\nchildhood days when he was beaten and sent to bed hungry by the stern\\nbut well-meaning Frankh; on his days of neglect and cruel insult under\\nReuter; on his homeless wanderings through the streets of Vienna, on that\\nchill November night, not knowing how to obtain food and shelter; on his\\nhumiliating lackey services to Porpora. It was all over now, however, and\\nhe was never again to know want for the half century he had yet to live.\\n\\nIn his first year with Count Morzin, Haydn, taking advantage of the\\nopportunities afforded him for hearing his own music performed by\\nable musicians, wrote his first symphony. It is a brief work in three\\nmovements, for string quintet, two oboes, and two horns. It reflects\\nEmanuel Bach strongly, but in its brightness and easy flow foreshadows the\\nfuture style of the composer. It was the forerunner of one hundred and\\ntwenty-five symphonies, some of which were to break wholly with the past,\\nand to widen infinitely the bounds of instrumental music, and to pave\\nthe way for a Beethoven. Haydn was now in comparative wealth. His salary\\nwas two hundred florins ($100), and in addition he received board and\\nlodging free. Fortune seemed to smile on him at last. Unfortunately, in\\nthis bright hour he took a step which embittered his life for nearly forty\\nyears.\\n\\nWhen Haydn was in the depths of poverty that attended his early days of\\nadversity he made the acquaintance of one Keller, a wig-maker. This person\\nhad two daughters to whom Haydn gave music lessons. He fell desperately\\nin love with the younger, but she entered a convent and took the veil.\\nHer father, however, urgently entreated Haydn to marry the other, and in\\nan evil hour he consented, though she was three years his elder. When\\nprosperity dawned on him, with equal honesty and ill luck he kept his\\npromise, and on the 26th of November, 1760, the girl became his wife. It\\nwas not long before he discovered his irreparable mistake. The partner\\nhe had taken for life was a vixen, foul-mouthed, quarrelsome, a bigot\\nin religion, reckless in extravagance, utterly unappreciative of her\\nhusband\\'s genius, and, as he complained, \"did not care whether he was\\nan artist or a cobbler,\" as long as he could supply her with money. She\\nbickered with him constantly, insulted him for his inability to clothe her\\nexpensively, refused to know his friends, and acted like the virago that\\nshe was on the slightest provocation. Naturally genial and affectionate,\\nand peculiarly fitted for a happy domestic life by his peaceful and\\namiable temperament, it is not surprising that he soon wearied of the\\nwoman who made existence a torture to him. No children came to soften\\nthe asperities of this ill-assorted union, and if Haydn turned from it\\nto find the happiness and the comfort that were resolutely denied him at\\nhis own fireside, and at last became addicted to gallantry, excuse if not\\npardon may be accorded him. They lived apart during the greater portion\\nof their married life, but were not formally separated until thirty-two\\nyears later. She passed the last years of her life at Baden, near Vienna,\\npreceding her husband to the grave by nine years.\\n\\n[Illustration: BUST OF JOSEPH HAYDN, TAKEN FROM LIFE.\\n\\nFrom an India proof of an engraving by J. Thompson of drawing by\\nHammerton. Presented to the publisher for Surmon\\'s Exeter Hall edition of\\n\"The Creation\" by the Chevalier Neukomm.]\\n\\nIt was not long after this marriage that the good Count Morzin found\\nhimself unable to maintain his orchestra longer, and therefore he was\\ncompelled to dismiss it and its conductor. Haydn was thus thrown on his\\nown resources again, but not for long. By this time he had made a name for\\nhimself, and fortunately Prince Paul Anton Esterhazy had been a frequent\\nvisitor at Count Morzin\\'s and heard much of Haydn\\'s music there. It had\\nimpressed him greatly by its originality and its spirit. On the breaking\\nup of the orchestra the Prince at once engaged Haydn as his second\\nCapellmeister, and in May, 1761, when he was twenty-nine years old, he\\nwent to Eisenstadt in Hungary, where was the country seat of the richest\\nand most liberal of the Austrian nobles. There Haydn\\'s wandering ended,\\nfor in service of this family he was fated to remain for the rest of his\\nlife.\\n\\nThe Esterhazy family was distinguished for its love of music, and the\\nfirst Prince Paul, who died nearly fifty years before Haydn entered\\non his long connection with this house, founded a private chapel, the\\nperformers in which were increased in number from time to time. There were\\na chorus, solo singers, and an orchestra, and they participated not only\\nin the church services, but in concerts and eventually in operas. When\\nHaydn joined the orchestra it consisted of only sixteen musicians, but\\nthey were all excellent artists, and the precision and finish of their\\nplaying surpassed anything of the kind that Haydn had previously heard.\\nHe was now free to exercise his musical invention in any direction that\\nhe saw fit to choose. The orchestra was at his call on any day and at any\\nhour, and he was thus enabled to experiment with it, and as he himself\\nsaid, \"to observe what was good and what was weak in effect, and was\\nconsequently in a position to better, to change, to amplify, to curtail\"\\nhis music according as a hearing of it suggested. He was now free from all\\ncare, cut off from the outer world, and able to give full play to the art\\naspirations that were in him.\\n\\nWith all this independence on one side, on the other he was in a position\\nnot much higher than that of an upper servant. The agreement between\\nHaydn and the Prince is still in existence, and some of its stipulations\\nare so curiously humiliating that they are worth reproducing here. It is\\nimpressed on Haydn that he must be temperate; must abstain from vulgarity\\nin eating and drinking and conversation; must take care of all the music\\nand the musical instruments, and be answerable for any injury they may\\nsuffer from carelessness or neglect; that as he is an expert on various\\ninstruments, he shall take care to practice on all that he is acquainted\\nwith; that when summoned to perform before company he shall take care that\\nhe and all members of his orchestra do follow the instructions given and\\nappear in white stockings, white linen, powder, and with either a pig-tail\\nor a tie-wig. For pay, a salary of four hundred florins, to be received\\nquarterly \"is hereby _bestowed_ upon the said Vice-Capellmeister by his\\nSerene Highness.\" In addition, Haydn is permitted to have board at the\\nofficers\\' table, or half a gulden a day in lieu thereof. The whole tone\\nof the contract places the composer in the light of a menial. It is by no\\nmeans likely that it was made intentionally offensive, and, in fact, it\\nis doubtful if Haydn found it so. In Germany at that time, the musician\\nwas not highly considered socially, and the composer was far less esteemed\\nthan were the virtuoso of eminence and the vocalist of superior abilities.\\nWe read of musicians, in the establishments of some of these princely\\npatrons, who, when they were not needed to play to entertain the guests,\\nwere expected to wait on table or to assist in the kitchen.\\n\\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO HAYDN IN VIENNA.\\n\\nFrom a photograph.]\\n\\nThe chief Capellmeister, and nominally the head of the orchestra, was\\nGregorius Josephus Werner, an industrious musician, of whose compositions\\nnothing has come down to us, and of which nothing deserved to come down.\\nHe was now old, and was to all intents and purposes replaced by Haydn,\\nwhose revolutionary ideas and innovations generally must have greatly\\ndisturbed the calm of his prim, formal, and pedagogic chief, who, in fact,\\nrarely spoke of him except as \"a mere fop\" and \"a song scribbler.\" Haydn,\\non the contrary, always expressed a warm respect for the old musician,\\nwho lived for five years under the new order of things and then ceased to\\nrepine, in death. But Prince Paul Anton died four years earlier, in fact\\nbefore Haydn had been in his service for quite a year, and was succeeded\\nby his brother Prince Nicolaus, the \"great Esterhazy,\" famous for the\\nlavishness with which he displayed his wealth and for the enthusiasm of\\nhis love for and patronage of the fine arts.\\n\\nUnder Prince Nicolaus a new order of things began, and his generosity was\\nat once illustrated. The salaries of all the musicians were increased,\\nHaydn\\'s four hundred florins being increased to six hundred and shortly\\nafter to seven hundred and eighty-two, or about three hundred and ninety\\ndollars of our money. The force of the Capelle was enlarged to seven\\nsingers and fourteen instrumentalists, and rehearsals took place every\\nday. By this time, a knowledge of Haydn\\'s music existed outside his own\\ncountry, and his works were beginning to be known in London, Paris, and\\nAmsterdam, and five years after he had been at Eisenstadt, the official\\njournal of Vienna, the _Wiener Diarium_, alludes to him as \"der Liebling\\nunserer Nation.\" His industry was unrelaxing, for he had already composed,\\nunder the Esterhazys, some thirty symphonies and cassations, several\\ndivertimenti in five parts, six string trios, a concerto for French horn,\\ntwelve minuets for orchestra, besides concertos, trios, sonatas and\\nvariations for the clavier. His vocal compositions were a Salve Regina\\nfor soprano and alto, two violins and organ; a Te Deum; four Italian\\noperettas; a pastoral, \"Acis and Galatea,\" written for the marriage of\\nCount Anton, eldest son of Prince Nicolaus; and a cantata in honor of\\nthe Prince\\'s return from the coronation of Archduke Joseph as king of\\nthe Romans. In none of these works did Haydn rise to any high power. The\\ngreater Haydn was yet to develop.\\n\\nTo go through, in detail, his life at Eisenstadt would be only to repeat\\nwhat has been already said, and to give a catalogue of his compositions\\nin the order in which they were written. We shall therefore pass in rapid\\nview the events of his career and leave a consideration of his works until\\nwe reach the point when it becomes necessary to estimate the musician\\nrather than the man. It may, perhaps, be interesting to describe Haydn as\\nhe appeared personally to his contemporaries. He wore a uniform of light\\nblue and silver, knee breeches, white stockings, lace ruffles and white\\nneckcloth. His biographer, Dies, states: \"Haydn was below the middle\\nheight, and his legs were somewhat too short for his body, a defect which\\nwas made more noticeable because of the style of attire he affected and\\nwhich he obstinately declined to change as the fashions changed. His\\nfeatures were regular, his expression was spirited and at the same time\\ntemperate, amiable and winning. His face was stern when in repose, but\\nsmiling and cheerful when he conversed. I never heard him laugh. In build\\nhe was firm; he was lacking in muscle.\" He had a prominent aquiline\\nnose disfigured by a polypus which he refused to have removed, and he\\nwas heavily pitted by small pox. His complexion was dark, so dark, in\\nfact, that he was playfully called \"The Moor.\" His jaw was heavy and his\\nunder-lip was large and hanging. Lavater described the eyes and nose of\\nHaydn as something out of the common; his brow noble and good, but his\\nmouth and chin \"Philistine.\" Haydn\\'s own opinion was that he was ugly, and\\nhe took pleasure in reflecting that it surely was not for his personal\\nbeauty that so many women were attracted to him. That he tried to make\\nhimself attractive to the opposite sex by extreme neatness of attire,\\nsuavity of manner, and flattery, in which he was an adept, is certain;\\nand that he never lacked for warm admiration and even devoted love from\\nwomen is no less well-established. He was very fond of fun, even that\\nwhich was not wholly refined, and a predilection for rough practical\\njoking abided with him to the last. He was sincere and unaffected in his\\npiety and looked upon his talent as a gift from God, to be used dutifully\\nin His service. It was seldom that he began to pen a composition without\\nwriting at its head, _In Nomine Domini_, and at its end, _Laus Deo_. Now\\nand then he merely used the initials L.D., or S.D.G. (_Soli Deo Gloria_)\\nand sometimes he wrote B.V.M. (_Beatæ Virgini Mariæ_). This custom was\\nretained not only in his works for the church, but in those for the\\norchestra and even for the stage; and the most elaborate dedication of all\\nis that to his opera \"L\\'Infidelita Delusa,\" which he closes with _Laus\\nomnipotenti Deo et Beatissimæ Virgini Mariæ_.\\n\\nHaydn\\'s life at Eisenstadt, as it was at Esterhaz, to which Prince\\nNicolaus and his household removed in 1766, was one of almost complete\\nseclusion from the outer world and of unflagging work. The quantity of\\nmusic he wrote was enormous and the rapidity with which he poured it forth\\nwas astonishing. At Esterhaz he was obliged to provide for two operatic\\nperformances and for one or two formal concerts each week, in addition\\nto the daily music. It was here that Haydn wrote nearly all his operas,\\nthe greater number of his arias and songs, and the bulk of his orchestral\\nand chamber music. The vast quantity of music he wrote and the rapidity\\nwith which he produced it has given rise to the belief that he composed\\nquickly; but such was not the case. His work was always carefully thought\\nout, and whenever an idea occurred to him that he thought of musical value\\nand worth elaborating, he pondered long over it and only began to write it\\nout finally after he was, as he said, \"fully convinced that it was as it\\nshould be.\" He was now in receipt of a salary of one thousand florins, or\\nabout five hundred dollars, and it is stated that he nearly doubled this\\nby the sale of his compositions. His operas, of which he was specially\\nfond, brought him the least profit. The extravagance of his wife, however,\\nkept him constantly embarrassed in his money affairs, and an attachment he\\nformed for one of the singers in the chapel, Luigia Polzelli, did not mend\\nmatters.\\n\\n[Illustration: SILHOUETTE OF HAYDN.\\n\\nProbably suggested by the miniature portrait]\\n\\nFor the rest, the story of Haydn\\'s life is little else than a catalogue\\nof his works. From 1766, the year in which he became, by the death of\\nWerner, the head of the Esterhazy Capelle, to 1790, the year of his first\\nvisit to London, nearly a quarter of a century, was the most fruitful\\nperiod of his musical career. His greatest works, however, were yet to be\\nwritten. Though he was already famous, he was not permitted to hold his\\nposition unassailed, and many and violent were the attacks upon him for\\nhis innovations and his disdain for pedagogic rules, by the critics of the\\nolder and more conservative school. Honors, nevertheless, began to pour in\\non him. The Philharmonic Society of Modena elected him a member in 1780.\\nIn 1784, Prince Henry of Prussia sent him a gold medal and his portrait in\\nreturn for six quartets dedicated to him. In 1787, King Frederick William\\nII. gave him a diamond ring as a recognition of his merit as a composer.\\nIn the meanwhile, in 1785, he received a commission to compose the \"Seven\\nLast Words of Christ\" for the Cathedral of Cadiz, a fact which evidences\\nhow far his reputation had travelled from the solitude of Esterhaz. In the\\nperiod named, he had written eight masses including the famous \"Mariazell\"\\nmass in C, and the great \"Cecilia\" mass, the largest and most difficult of\\nall his works in this kind, and now only performed in a condensed form.\\nWithin the same period he wrote sixty-three symphonies, most of which are\\nin his earlier style, though a steady progress is shown toward the master\\nsymphonies he wrote for the London concerts.\\n\\nDuring his residence at Esterhaz he wrote over forty quartets, and\\nthese were, up to the time of his departure for London, his greatest\\nachievements. It was in these that he became the originator of modern\\nchamber music and led the way to both Mozart and Beethoven. His clavier\\nmusic still was under the influence of Emanuel Bach, though the\\ntwenty-eight sonatas that belong to this period, in freedom, melody\\nand clearness are far in advance of anything that had been previously\\nachieved. Seventeen clavier trios are also the product of this period and\\nare still full of charm. He did not begin to write songs until he was\\nnearly fifty years old, and the twenty-four he composed at Esterhaz were\\nby no means of marked value. His part-songs were of a better order, but\\nhis canons were best of all, and may be still heard with pleasure.\\n\\nIt was during his stay at Esterhaz that his friendship for Mozart\\ndeveloped; and never was one great genius more cordially or sincerely\\nadmired by another than was Mozart by Haydn; and so frank was his\\nrecognition of the younger composer\\'s worth, that he was fond of declaring\\nthat he never heard one of Mozart\\'s compositions without learning\\nsomething from it. He pronounced Mozart \"the greatest composer in the\\nworld,\" and affirmed that if he had written nothing but his violin\\nquartets and the \"Requiem\" he would have done enough to insure his\\nimmortality. The personal friendship between the two masters was a tender\\none and like that of father and son. On the eve of Haydn\\'s departure for\\nLondon Mozart was deeply moved and lamented their separation. With tears\\nin his eyes he said to Haydn, \"We shall never see each other again on\\nearth,\" a prophecy that was only too literally fulfilled. When Haydn, then\\nin London, heard of Mozart\\'s death he grieved over it bitterly and with\\ntears, and he wrote to a friend that his joy of returning home would be\\ngloomy because he should not be greeted by the great Mozart.\\n\\nIt was in 1787 that Haydn received an urgent invitation from Cramer, the\\nviolinist, to visit London, but without any favorable results. Salomon\\ntook more practical measures, and in 1789 sent Bland, the music publisher,\\nto try what personal persuasion could effect. It achieved nothing at this\\ntime, and Bland was obliged to return and to inform Salomon of the failure\\nof the scheme. Haydn would not leave his \"well-beloved Prince,\" but\\n\"wished to live and die with him.\" In a favorable hour for musical art,\\nPrince Nicolaus died after a brief illness, in 1790. Haydn was in despair\\nand mourned him devotedly. The Prince testified to his appreciation of the\\nfaithful services of his devoted Capellmeister by leaving him an annual\\npension of one thousand florins, on the condition that he consented to\\nretain the title of Capellmeister to the Esterhazys. The Prince must have\\nknown that the Capelle would be dismissed by Prince Anton, his successor,\\nwhose taste for music was very slight. He discharged all the musicians\\nexcept the wind band, which was retained to perform at banquets and\\nother ceremonials. Prince Anton nevertheless was not unkind to those he\\ndismissed, for he gave them gratuities and added four hundred florins to\\nthe pension of Haydn.\\n\\nFrom this moment, Haydn was for the first time his own master, free to\\ngo whither he would. His fame, which was world-wide, assured him a warm\\nwelcome, no heed in what capital he might take up his residence, and his\\npensions and his savings secured him from all fear for the comfort of his\\ndeclining years. He was now fifty-eight years of age. He took up his abode\\nin Vienna and soon received an invitation to become Capellmeister to Count\\nGrassalcovics. This he declined; but one day shortly after, he received\\na visit from a stranger who announced himself as Salomon of London, and\\nwas determined to take Haydn there will he nil he. Haydn resisted for\\na time, but at last all was arranged favorably to Salomon, who, by the\\nway, was a famous violinist and conductor who was the projector of some\\nprominent London subscription concerts. The terms which were agreed upon\\nwere as follows: Haydn was to have for one season: ￡300 for an opera for\\nGallini, the owner and manager of the King\\'s Theatre in Drury Lane; ￡300\\nfor six symphonies and ￡200 additional for the copyright of them; ￡200\\nfor twenty new compositions to be produced by Haydn at a like number of\\nconcerts, and ￡200 guaranteed as the proceeds of a benefit concert for\\nhim, ￡1,200 in all, or 12,000 florins. His travelling expenses were paid\\nby himself with the assistance of a loan of 450 florins from the Prince.\\nHe left Vienna with Salomon on the 15th of December, 1790, and arrived\\non English soil on the 1st of January, 1791. His reception in London was\\nenthusiastic. Noblemen and ambassadors called on him; he was overwhelmed\\nwith invitations from the highest society and distinguished artists\\nhastened to pay him homage. The musical societies fought for his presence\\nat their performances, his symphonies and quartets were played, his\\ncantata \"Ariadne a Naxos\" was sung by the celebrated Pachierotto and the\\nnewspapers vied with each other in honoring him.\\n\\nThe first of his six symphonies composed for Salomon was played March\\n11, 1791, at the Hanover Square Rooms, the composer conducting it at the\\npianoforte. The orchestra, led by Salomon, consisted of nearly forty\\nperformers. The work was received with a storm of applause and the Adagio\\nwas encored,--a rare event in that day. The other symphonies were no less\\nsuccessful, and were the finest works in their kind that Haydn had written\\nup to that time. His benefit, which took place in May, was guaranteed to\\nnet him ￡200 but it produced for him ￡350. He was feted constantly and\\nenthusiasm attended him wherever he went. Oxford conferred on him the\\nhonorary degree of Doctor of Music during the Oxford Commemoration, an\\nimportant feature of which was three concerts. At the second of these,\\nHaydn\\'s \"Oxford\" symphony was performed, Haydn giving the tempi at the\\norgan. At the third concert he appeared in his Doctor\\'s gown amid the\\nwildest plaudits. He was the guest of the Prince of Wales for three days,\\nand at a concert given all the music was of Haydn\\'s composition, and the\\nPrince of Wales played the \\'cello. In the meantime Salomon made a new\\ncontract with him which prevented him from complying with a recall from\\nPrince Esterhazy, to give his services in a grand fete for the Emperor. He\\ngave many lessons at his own price. Among his pupils was the widow of the\\nQueen\\'s music master, Mrs. Schroeder. Haydn\\'s susceptibilities were again\\ntouched, and though his pupil was over sixty, he said afterward: \"Had I\\nbeen free I certainly should have married her.\" To her he dedicated three\\nclavier trios. He quitted London in June, 1792, and when he reached Bonn,\\nBeethoven called on him for his opinion of a cantata. At Frankfort Haydn\\nmet Prince Anton at the coronation of the Emperor Francis II. At last he\\nreached Vienna, where he was welcomed with wild enthusiasm and there was\\nthe greatest eagerness to hear his great London symphonies. Did Haydn at\\nthis triumphant moment recall the homeless young man who wandered through\\nthe streets of the city on a November evening forty-three years ago,\\npenniless and despairing, and hopeless regarding his future prospects?\\n\\n[Illustration: JOSEPH HAYDN.\\n\\nFrom a miniature painted on ivory about 1785 to 1790, shortly before his\\nvisit to London.\\n\\nAmong the friends who tried to dissuade him from making this journey was\\nMozart, who said to him: \"Papa, you have not been brought up for the great\\nworld; you know too few languages.\" Haydn replied: \"But my language is\\nunderstood by the whole world.\"]\\n\\nAt the end of this year Beethoven went to Haydn for instruction, and\\nthe lessons continued until Haydn\\'s second departure for London. The\\nconnection between these two geniuses was not a happy one. There can\\nbe no doubt that Haydn neglected his pupil. In fact, in the midst of\\nhis social triumphs and at the height of his fame, giving lessons in\\ncounterpoint could not have had much attraction for him; moreover the\\ntwenty cents an hour that Beethoven paid for instruction was scarcely as\\ntempting to the Haydn of that day as it would have been to the Haydn of\\nfifty years before. The breach between the old and the young composer\\nwidened. The latter went to Schenk, a reputable musician, for additional\\nlessons, and then refused to call himself Haydn\\'s pupil. Haydn at one time\\nintended to take Beethoven to England with him, but the latter, whenever\\noccasion offered, made unflattering and contemptuous remarks about the old\\nman, and these irritating him and wounding his self-esteem caused him to\\nabandon his intention. Later, Beethoven\\'s resentment softened, and when on\\nhis deathbed he was shown a view of Haydn\\'s humble birth-place, he said:\\n\"To think that so great a man should have been born in a common peasant\\'s\\nhovel.\"\\n\\nWhile in Vienna Haydn paid a visit to his native village Rohrau, the\\noccasion being the inauguration of a monument erected in his honor by\\nCount Harrach, in whose household Haydn\\'s mother had been a cook. The\\nemotions of the composer may be imagined. The little boy who fifty-four\\nyears earlier quitted home to study with the pedagogue Frankh, returned\\nin the glory of a fame that was world-wide, and one of the greatest of\\ncomposers, honored of monarchs, and courted of all. Good fortune had\\nfollowed him from the first; and though he suffered much in those sad,\\nearly days, every change in his position was for the better. Far different\\nwas the fate of a still greater master, the luckless Mozart.\\n\\nIn 1794, Haydn departed on his second journey to London under contract to\\nSalomon to compose six new symphonies. Prince Anton parted unwillingly\\nwith him and died three days after. The success of the previous visit was\\nrepeated, and his reception was even still more fervent and enthusiastic.\\nToward the end of this stay he was much distinguished by the Court. At\\na concert at York House, the King and Queen, the Princesses, the Prince\\nof Wales, and the Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester were present, and the\\nPrince of Wales presented Haydn to the King. Both the King and Queen urged\\nhim to remain in England and pass the summer at Windsor; but Haydn replied\\nthat he could not abandon Prince Esterhazy, and beside, the Prince\\nhad already written that he wished to reorganize his chapel with Haydn\\nas conductor. He returned to his native land, his powers still further\\ndeveloped, his fame increased and his fortune enlarged. By concerts,\\nlessons and symphonies he made twelve thousand florins ($6000) enough,\\nadded to what he already possessed, to give him no further anxiety for the\\nfuture.\\n\\nAgain was his welcome home marked by the most demonstrative cordiality.\\nFrom this time out there is but little to relate except to repeat the\\nstory of his industry and his musical fecundity, until the culmination\\nof his artistic career was reached in the works of his old age, \"The\\nCreation\" and \"The Seasons.\" The success of both was enormous, and he\\ncomposed very little after the latter work. His health began to fail, and\\nhe laid it at the door of \"The Seasons.\" He said, \"I should never have\\nundertaken it. It gave me the finishing stroke.\" He lived in comparative\\nseclusion, and only once more appeared in public, the occasion being a\\nperformance of \"The Creation.\" He was then seventy-six years of age.\\nAs he entered the concert room he was saluted by a fanfare of trumpets\\nand the cheers of the audience. His excitement was so great that it was\\nthought advisable to take him home at the end of the first part. As he\\nwas borne out friends and pupils surrounded him to take leave. Beethoven\\nwas present, and bent down to kiss the old man\\'s hands and forehead. All\\nanimosities were soothed in that last hour of triumph; the crowning moment\\nand the close of a great master\\'s career. When Haydn reached the door he\\nurged his bearers to pause and turn him face toward the orchestra. Then\\nhe raised his hands as if in benediction, and in a long, lingering glance\\nbade farewell to the art to which he had been devoted since the time when,\\nas a boy, he hoarded his florins to purchase the precious volume of Fux,\\nwhich he placed under his pillow when he slept, down to this pathetic\\nculminating moment.\\n\\nHaydn\\'s life passed peacefully until in 1809 Vienna was bombarded by the\\nFrench, and a shell fell near his dwelling. His servants were alarmed,\\nbut he cried in a loud voice, \"Fear not, children. No harm can happen to\\nyou while Haydn is here.\" The city was occupied by the enemy, and the\\nlast visitor Haydn ever received was a French officer, who sang to him,\\n\"In native worth.\" Haydn was deeply affected and embraced his guest\\nwarmly at parting. A few days afterward, he called his servants about him\\nfor the last time, and bidding them carry him to the piano he played the\\nEmperor\\'s Hymn, three times. Five days later, May 31, 1809, that busy\\nlife ended peacefully. He was buried in the Hundsthurm Churchyard, close\\nto the suburb in which he had lived; but eleven years later the remains\\nwere exhumed by order of Prince Esterhazy and reinterred in the parish\\nchurch at Eisenstadt. When the coffin was opened for identification before\\nremoval, the skull was missing. A skull was sent to the Prince from an\\nunknown source and was buried with the other remains; but there are good\\ngrounds for the belief that the real skull is in the possession of the\\nfamily of an eminent physician of Vienna.\\n\\n[Illustration: HAYDN\\'S GRAVE IN HUNDSTHURM CHURCHYARD.\\n\\nAt Gumpendorf, a suburb of Vienna, from whence the remains were taken to\\nthe parish church at Eisenstadt.]\\n\\nFifteen days after his death Mozart\\'s Requiem was performed in honor of\\nhis memory at the Schotterkirche. Numerous French officers were among the\\nmourners, and the guard of honor about the bier was chiefly composed of\\nFrench soldiers No sooner did Haydn\\'s death become known, than funeral\\nservices were held in all the principal cities of Europe.\\n\\nThe list of Haydn\\'s compositions is enormous. It includes 125 symphonies;\\n30 trios for strings, and strings and wind; 77 quartets for strings; 20\\nconcertos for clavier; 31 concertos for various other instruments; 38\\ntrios for piano and strings; 53 sonatas and divertissements for clavier; 4\\nsonatas for clavier and violin; 14 masses; 1 Stabat Mater; 8 oratorios and\\ncantatas; 19 operas; 42 canons for voice in two and more parts; 175 pieces\\nfor the baritone; and a vast collection of other works, among which are a\\ncollection of over 300 original Scotch songs in three parts with violin\\nand bass accompaniments and symphonies.\\n\\nIn estimating Haydn\\'s life-work as a composer, the principal stress must\\nbe laid on him as a reformer in his art. Contrapuntally, music had reached\\nits highest development, but in many other important directions it was\\nat a low ebb. Concerted music had not yet achieved any prominence as a\\ndistinct branch of the art. Vocal music was in the ascendant and the\\nchurch and the opera-house offered the principal if not the only means\\nfor composers to achieve distinction. In Vienna, the Emperor, Joseph\\nII., was a liberal patron of music, and the nobles, after the fashion\\nof nobles generally, followed the example of the court, and entered\\ninto rivalry with each other in founding and supporting costly musical\\nestablishments of their own. The Viennese, however, had no very marked\\nsympathy with art at its highest. One hundred and twenty-five years ago,\\nLeopold Mozart wrote: \"The Viennese public love nothing that is serious or\\nreasonable; they have not the sense to understand it, and their theatres\\nprove sufficiently that nothing but rubbish such as dances, burlesque,\\nharlequinades, ghost magic and devil\\'s tricks will satisfy them. A fine\\ngentleman, even with an order on his breast, may be seen laughing till\\nthe tears run down his cheeks, applauding as heartily as he can, some bit\\nof foolish buffoonery; while in a highly pathetic scene he will chatter\\nso noisily with a lady that his wiser and better-mannered neighbors can\\nscarcely hear a word of the piece.\" From which it will be seen that\\nfashion changes but little as time passes.\\n\\nInstrumental music was, for the most part, confined to dance tunes, and\\nminuets, allemands, waltzes and landler were the rage. Presently these\\nrose to importance and musicians began to take greater care in composing\\nthem, until at length came the suite, which was formed of a series of\\ndances all written in the same key but varying in accent and character.\\nThen followed a second part to the minuet, in the fifth of the key, and a\\nreturn to the first part, which proved to be the stepping-stone to form;\\nand the minuet survived the suite, of which it was originally a part, and\\ncontinued an indispensable element of the symphony down to the time that\\nBeethoven enlarged it into the scherzo.\\n\\nIn considering the influence that Haydn exercised on instrumental music\\nit may perhaps be interesting to take a passing glance at the condition\\nof orchestration when he began to compose. The string band, then, as now,\\nwas the foundation of the whole, and the wind instruments were used to add\\nsolidity to the score. The orchestra generally consisted of the string\\nquintet, two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two trumpets, two horns and\\ntympani. The first oboe did little else than duplicate the first violins,\\nwhile the second oboe only appeared now and then with a holding note, or\\ndoubled the first oboe. The first bassoon either played in unison with the\\nbass or sustained the fundamental harmony, while the second bassoon, from\\ntime to time, doubled the first. The violas rarely had an independent part\\nand as a rule duplicated the bass. It is true that Haydn had before him\\nthe example of Stamitz, who gave an independent part to the viola in some\\nof his symphonies, but the innovation does not seem to have influenced\\nHaydn. Trumpets, horns and drums had but little to do except to produce\\nnoise when contrast in effect was deemed necessary. Unquestionably,\\nEmanuel Bach departed somewhat from this conventional and circumscribed\\ntreatment of the orchestra and gave to his wind instruments independent\\nparts. In his symphony in E-flat is to be found, amid the customary unison\\nand octave passages for the strings, some charming and even piquant\\nfree writing for the wind, together with a marked feeling for contrasts\\nbetween the wind and the strings. The horns, especially, are used with a\\ngenuine appreciation of their peculiar quality of tone and the effect of\\ntheir timbre. Occasionally the strings remain silent and the wood wind\\nare heard alone. More than this, for there is an attempt to employ\\nall the instruments in a manner calculated to let their characteristic\\nindividualities produce their due effect in regard to tone-color; but,\\nstrangely enough, Haydn does not appear to have been in any way swayed\\nby the innovations of his great predecessor, whose clavier works he had\\nstudied so assiduously. Still, a near and an inevitable change in the\\nmethods of writing for the orchestra was in the air, and the ground was\\nnot wholly unprepared for Haydn.\\n\\n[Music: Fac-simile of original sketch made by Haydn for the Austrian\\nHymn, in which the melody and harmony differ somewhat from the published\\nversion.]\\n\\nThe orchestration of John Sebastian Bach was thin despite its elaboration.\\nThe strings formed the foundation, according to the prevailing rule, and\\nwere written in so many real parts, and when wind instruments appeared,\\nthey were also used with an independent polyphony. His contrasts were, for\\nthe most part, produced by giving a melody to a simple solo instrument,\\naccompanied only by a bass, while a figured bass indicated the chords\\nto be filled in by the organ or the clavier. It can hardly be said that\\nthe greatest of the Bachs advanced the art and science of orchestration.\\nHandel\\'s scoring was in quite another vein, and may be viewed as\\nrevolutionary for its era. In his overtures, especially, his strings are\\nused with the evident object of producing solidity in effect. The oboes\\noften strengthen the violins in unison and the bassoons perform the same\\nservice for the basses, but he also used these instruments independently\\nand to embroider the broad and simple themes of the strings. In addition,\\nhe made use of the latter and of the wind separately, each body full\\nin itself and responding each to the other. Now and then he used three\\ntrumpets, and in his \"Rinaldo\" he resorts to four, giving the bass to the\\ndrums. In \"Saul\" he uses three trombones. Clarinets were unknown to him,\\nand the bass tuba was unborn in his day; but otherwise he was acquainted\\nwith all the instruments of the modern orchestra and made use of them. One\\ncannot recall an instance in which he used them all in combination, and\\nhence, the four trumpets of \"Rinaldo\" and the three trombones of \"Saul\"\\nare not heard together in any of his scores. Notwithstanding the fame of\\nHandel, his daring innovations in orchestration do not seem to have been\\nstudied by Haydn, or if they were, they exercised no early influence over\\nhim.\\n\\nGluck\\'s scores must be considered epoch-making in the art of\\norchestration. His \"Orpheus\" was produced in 1762 when Haydn was thirty\\nyears of age; his \"Iphigenie en Aulide\" was produced in 1774, and the\\nother \"Iphigenie\" was given in 1779. In these works instrumentation was\\nadvanced to an extent that broke almost wholly with the past. When Gluck\\ndied Haydn was in his fifty-fifth year, and yet the older composer, the\\nreport of whose world-wide fame must have reached Haydn\\'s ears, even in\\nthe seclusion of Eisenstadt, does not appear to have suggested anything to\\nHaydn. The twelve great Salomon symphonies, Haydn\\'s, till then, highest\\nachievements in orchestral writing, were not produced until some seven\\nyears after Gluck\\'s death, and in them the influence is unmistakably that\\nof Mozart, who had undoubtedly studied Gluck thoroughly.\\n\\nThe word \"symphony\" had various meanings before it became fixed as a name\\nfor the highest form of instrumental music. It was, however, generally\\nunderstood to signify an overture, and its closest connection was with\\nthe opera. Originally it was merely a notification to the audience that\\nthe opera was about to begin; an appeal for silence and to concentrate\\nattention on the coming entrance of the singers. The French \"symphony,\" as\\nexemplified by Lully, opened with a slow movement followed by an allegro,\\nfrequently in fugue form, and passed again into an adagio which ended the\\noverture. The Italian symphony consisted of three movements, the first\\nof which was a moderate allegro, the second an adagio, and the last a\\nlivelier and lighter allegro; and the Italian overture, as will be seen,\\nbecame the foundation of the modern symphony as far as the positions of\\nthe movements are concerned. Before Haydn, Stamitz, Abel, J. C. Bach and\\nWagenseil, as well as Emanuel Bach, had written symphonies, and a symphony\\nby Stamitz, in D, is peculiarly interesting, inasmuch as its form is\\ncompletely in accordance with that which was established permanently by\\nHaydn. The opening movement is an Allegro, with the familiar double bar\\nwith the repeats and the binary form. The second movement is an Andante\\nin the dominant; the third is a Minuet that has even the Trio, and the\\nfinale is a Presto. The clavier sonatas of Ph. Emanuel Bach congealed this\\nform and had a permanent influence on it, in the impression they made upon\\nHaydn, who, by his mastery of his art, his amazing fecundity in invention\\nand his unflagging productive powers, was enabled to increase the scope\\nand aim of this form so greatly as to entitle him to be recognized as the\\ncreator of the symphony. Haydn\\'s first symphony was written in 1759, for\\nCount Morzin. We are unaware of any printed copy of it in this country.\\nPohl describes it as a slight work in three movements for two violins,\\nviola, bass, two oboes and two horns. It appears to be modelled on the\\nsymphonies of Stamitz, Abel and John Christian Bach. The symphonies that\\nfollowed differed but little in character from this one and afford little\\nif any insight into Haydn\\'s influence on the symphonic form. He appears\\nto have followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, curiously enough,\\nignoring the symphonies of Emanuel Bach. The orchestration is meagre and\\nconventional, the violins are almost constantly playing, and the wind\\nis only used to duplicate them. It is not until we come to the first\\nsymphony composed by him at Eisenstadt that we see him as an innovator.\\nThis work is in C-major, and is generally known as \"Le Matin.\" It is in\\nfour movements and begins with a few bars of adagio. The opening allegro\\nis remarkable for its variety of subjects and their treatment, and for\\nthe careful manner in which it worked out. Between this movement and the\\nadagio is a long dramatic recitative for the violin, very impressive, but\\nhaving no discoverable connection with what precedes or what follows it.\\nIn breadth, dignity, and expressiveness it surpasses anything that the\\ncomposer had hitherto produced. From this time forth the symphony steadily\\ngrew under Haydn\\'s hands; the form was enlarged, the orchestration\\nwas varied, the timbres of the different instruments were studied and\\ninstrumental effects gradually assumed an importance that increased with\\neach succeeding symphony. But his greatest symphonies were not written\\nuntil the period of the Salomon concerts. In the meanwhile Mozart had\\nappeared upon the scene. Haydn\\'s first symphony was produced when Mozart\\nwas three years old, and the latter died in the very year in which Haydn\\'s\\nconnection with the Salomon concerts began. That Haydn influenced Mozart\\'s\\nearly works is beyond question; that Mozart in turn, influenced Haydn\\nlater, is equally indisputable.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOSEPH HAYDN.\\n\\nFrom an engraving by J. E. Mansfield, published by Artaria, in Vienna,\\n1781. Haydn in his forty-ninth year.]\\n\\nIn \"Le Matin,\" before alluded to, the second violins play with the first,\\nand the viola with the basses almost through the whole of the first\\nmovement. The slow movement has no wind instruments whatever. In the\\nminuet, though, there is a long passage for wind instruments only, and\\nin the trio is an extensive and florid solo for bassoon. Haydn treated\\nthe strings in this same confined manner, and the wind after this solo\\nfashion for some twenty years. Then came an effort to make the strings\\nmore independent and to pay attention to the peculiar qualities of the\\nviola and violoncello. In the symphony in E-minor (Letter I) the wind is\\ngiven long holding notes while strings sustain the subject. This was the\\nfirst step toward greater freedom of orchestration in Haydn\\'s symphonies;\\nbut it was not until his \"Oxford\" symphony that he broke wholly with the\\npast. It was written in 1788, the same year in which Mozart produced his\\nthree greatest symphonies. This work is in his mature style, and the\\norchestration is delightfully clear, flexible and fresh. If he had written\\nno more symphonies after this, however, he would not have attained to the\\nrank he has won as a symphony composer. His fame in this walk of his art\\nwas assured by the twelve symphonies he wrote for Salomon after 1790. In\\nthese he reached his highest point. His mastery of form was perfected,\\nhis technical skill was unlimited, and he ventured into bold harmonic\\nprogressions that were little short of daring, for his time. His orchestra\\nhad been enlarged to two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two\\ntrumpets and drums, and in his three last symphonies, the two in D-minor\\nand the one in E-flat, two clarinets appear. It is in these twelve\\nsymphonies that the influence of Mozart is clearly manifested. The bass\\nhas attained to independence; the violas no longer duplicate it except\\nfor certain effects; the second violins have a free motion of their own;\\nthe wind instruments express musical ideas proper to them and appropriate\\nto their special qualities of utterance. The form and character of the\\nsymphony were established permanently.\\n\\nSimplicity, clearness of style, grace and playfulness are the leading\\nfeatures of Haydn\\'s symphonies. There are few of the more notable of them\\nin which his command over the science of his art is not delightfully\\nmanifested. Haydn is invariably lucid, always finished to the highest\\npoint, always logical and always free from display for the mere sake\\nof display. It is a prevailing fault to dwell too persistently on the\\ncheerful simplicity of Haydn\\'s music and to forget how serious and\\nprofound he could be when occasion demanded. These latter qualities are\\nnobly manifested in his more important symphonies in those portions\\nof them devoted to the \"working out.\" Such symphonies as appeared\\nbefore Haydn fixed the form and showed the capacity of that species of\\ncomposition have wholly disappeared. It would perhaps be over dogmatic\\nto assert that had it not been for Haydn the symphonies of Mozart and of\\nBeethoven would not have been what they are; but it is certain that Haydn\\ngave the impulse to both in as far as their symphony writing is concerned.\\n\\nOf the quartet Haydn may be justly called the inventor, and it is in this\\nphase of his art that he may be most profitably studied. The quartet\\nwas, as Otto Jahn truly says, \"Haydn\\'s natural mode of expressing his\\nfeelings,\" and it is in the quartet that Haydn\\'s growth and progress in\\nhis art are most strikingly illustrated. Their influence on music has been\\ngreater than that exerted by his symphonies. Here he is seen in his full\\nand his best strength, and it is here too that his extraordinary creative\\npowers are most brilliantly emphasized. When these works first appeared\\nthey were sneered at by the pedagogues of the day, but by-and-by more\\nrespect was shown to them even by their earlier antagonists, for it was\\nseen that the quartet was not only susceptible of depth of sentiment and\\nseriousness of treatment, but that musical learning also had in them a\\nfield for its finest development. These quartets, from the opportunities\\nthey afforded for performance in the family circle, exercised great\\ninfluence in raising the standard of taste, and in their educational\\naspects they were thus of the highest service. They crystallized form\\nand in essence may be looked on as the parent of all the serious and\\nso-called classical music that has been composed since. The progeny may\\nonly distantly resemble the parents, but the form establishes beyond all\\ncavil the family resemblance.\\n\\nHaydn\\'s first quartet is the merest shadow. The first half of the opening\\nmovement consists of no more than twenty-four bars. The subject comprises\\neight bars; then comes eight bars of an episode modulating into the\\ndominant, and then the second subject, also eight bars in length; but\\nbrief and pale as it is, it is unmistakably the germ that was elaborated\\nby Beethoven into such prodigious masterpieces. It is in the quartet that\\nHaydn found the fullest outlet for his wealth of musical thought, and\\nit is in the quartet that his genius is illustrated in its most marked\\nindividuality. Quartets were written before his day, and also by his\\ncontemporaries, J. C. Bach, Stamitz, Jomelli, Boccherini, and others, but\\nHaydn\\'s marvellous invention, his originality in the mastery of form, his\\nfine feeling for the characteristic speech of each instrument enabled him\\nto obtain a mastery that left him without a rival. His early quartets\\nare exceedingly thin, and are in such glaring contrast with what came\\nafter the composer had wholly developed the capacity of the quartet as a\\nmeans of profound expression of musical thought, that he is said to have\\nwished to ignore all his works in this class that preceded the nineteenth\\nquartet; but they are necessary to the student who would follow the\\ngrowth of musical form. It is an immense stride from the first of these\\ncompositions to the ever-beautiful \"Kaiser quartet,\" with its exquisite\\nvariations, or \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser.\" The advance from simple\\nharmonies to polyphonic treatment of the different parts, is a peculiarly\\ninteresting subject for study. Haydn stamped a character on the quartet\\nthat has never been departed from; and what is known as the \"quartet\\nstyle\" was established by him so thoroughly that in all the mutations in\\nmusical taste, it still remains a distinction that admits of no change.\\n\\nHaydn also left the impress of his genius on the sonata, though to Emanuel\\nBach is due the honor of having broken with the past as represented by\\nDomenico Scarlatti and Kuhnau. The same copiousness of invention and\\nperfection of form that characterize his quartets and symphonies are to be\\nfound in his sonatas, too much neglected at present, for in several of\\nhis later compositions of this class he appears to have gone further than\\nMozart and to have overlapped into the era of Beethoven. His trios for\\nclavier and strings are full of interest, but with two or three exceptions\\nthey are not of special value except as models. The strings are often\\nheld subordinate to the piano, and the outer voices are too persistently\\ndoubled. Of his other purely instrumental works, including concertos and\\ndivertimenti, nothing survives except the fine concerto for clavier in D\\nwith \"principal violin.\"\\n\\nHis songs, of which he wrote many, have passed for the most part into\\ndeserved oblivion. Some of his canzonets are marked by grace and delicacy,\\nbut the sign of age is unmistakably on them. His masses display that\\neternal freshness and that cheerfulness of spirit that are peculiarly\\nHaydn\\'s, and the more important of them must rank forever among the\\nmasterpieces of their class, notably the \"Mariazell\" Mass in C-major, and\\nthe \"Cecilia\" Mass, in the same key.\\n\\n\"The Seasons\" and \"The Creation\" are remarkable not only in themselves,\\nbut as productions of his old age. It is true that his fame does not rest\\non them, and it is equally true that if he had written nothing else these\\nworks would not have brought the composer\\'s name down to our day with the\\nglory that now surrounds it. Some portions of \"The Creation\" however, are\\nnoble music, and these will always be listened to with delight. Never\\nwas the human voice treated in a more masterly manner than it has been\\nby Haydn in these \"oratorios,\" and the study of their scores is still\\nvaluable to all who would learn how to support the voice by flowing and\\nbrilliant orchestration without giving undue prominence to the instruments.\\n\\nThe dramatic interest of \"The Creation\" is not strong. There is nothing\\nin the shape of declamation, and the singers are confined to mere\\ndescription. The result is a lack of passion and a consequent monotony of\\nsentiment. The tone-picture of Chaos, with which the work opens, stands\\nout as one of the noblest bits of instrumentation that Haydn ever wrote.\\nThe air \"With Verdure Clad\" is exquisite, in melody and orchestration,\\nbut its many repetitions mar it and make it tiresome. \"On mighty pens\" is\\nanother lovely air, but here too the composer has not been fortunate in\\nrespect to discreet brevity. The choruses reach a high point of beauty\\nin regard to themes, development and voice treatment, and \"The Heavens\\nare telling\" still remains one of the noblest oratorio choruses outside\\nof Bach and Handel. But the breadth and dignity of all the choruses are\\nimpaired by the elaborateness of the orchestration. Haydn was essentially\\nan instrumental composer, and it was but natural that he should have\\nyielded to the temptation to produce effects of which he was practically\\nthe inventor and at which the musical world still marvelled. It is, with\\nall its faults, an amazing work for a man not far from three-score and ten\\nyears of age; and it may still be listened to with pleasure, when the last\\npart is omitted; for the wooings and cooings of Adam and Eve have become\\nincurably old-fashioned; and the grace, melodiousness and tenderness of\\nthe music do not atone for its monotonous effect and its lack of dramatic\\ncolor.\\n\\n\"The Seasons,\" by its well sustained pastoral tone, its fresh and\\ncheerful melodies, the fidelity with which the composer has adhered to\\nthe spirit of his poem, and the simple grace of style that marks the work\\nthroughout, make it still delightful in the hearing when it is produced\\nwith care and in harmony with the chaste sentiment that pervades it.\\nWhen it is remembered that the composer compassed this work at the age\\nof 69, and consequently near the end of a busy life whose active pursuit\\nmight well have exhausted his capacity to invent, its wealth of melody is\\nastonishing. And yet, he said to Michael Kelly, \"It is the tune which is\\nthe charm of music, and it is that which is most difficult to produce.\" In\\nour day it would seem that tune is exhausted or that it is more difficult\\nto produce than it was. In this connection another saying of Haydn\\'s may\\nbe reproduced for the felicity with which it applies to the present time:\\n\"Where so many young composers fail is, that they string together a number\\nof fragments and break off almost as soon as they have begun; so that at\\nthe end the hearer carries away no clear impression.\" By omitting the word\\n\"young,\" the words will not be any the less true now.\\n\\nOf Haydn\\'s lighter vocal works there is no need to speak, for they have\\npassed away forever. His operas have been wholly forgotten, and not\\nunkindly. It is, however, as an instrumental composer that Haydn is\\nentitled to the most earnest consideration. In this field of his industry\\nhe has left an imperishable name. He was, to all intents and purposes, the\\ncreator of orchestral music. His place in musical history is among the\\ngreatest in his art. He broke with pedantry at the outset of his career,\\nenlarged the scope and dignified the aim of music, and made the world the\\nhappier for his presence and in the rich legacy he left it. Music has\\nchanged greatly since his day, and in its progress it has departed widely\\nand is still departing, even more widely, from the conditions in which he\\nleft it; but in all its changes it has left his position unassailed. His\\nbest achievements in his art are yet listened to with delight, despite\\nthe richer orchestration and the larger design that characterize the\\nmusic of our time. He has outlived every mutation thus far, and it is\\nperhaps not overbold to prophesy that his fame will endure long after the\\nvague, restless and labored music that is peculiar to the present era, is\\nforgotten. The moral of his life is devotion to art for art\\'s sake. He was\\nloyal to it through poverty, suffering and disappointment, never doubting\\nhis mission on earth. His early career was through tears, but as Heine\\nsays: \"The artist is the child in the fable, every one of whose tears was\\na pearl. Ah! the world, that cruel step-mother, beats the poor child the\\nharder, to make him shed more tears.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: B. E.

The date 1787 is incorrect._\\n]\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART\\n\\n\\nJohann Georg Mozart, the grandfather of the great composer, was a\\nbookbinder. He lived in Augsburg, and in 1708 he married Anna Maria\\nPeterin, the widow of a fellow-handicraftsman named Banneger. By her he\\nhad five children, and the youngest boy was Johann Georg Leopold, the\\nauthor of the \"Violin School\" and the father of Wolfgang, the immortal\\ncomposer.\\n\\nLeopold Mozart was a man of no ordinary parts. His face is known to us\\nby the engraving from the portrait painted by the amateur Carmontelle\\nin Paris, 1763, and by the family group in the Mozarteum in Salzburg.\\nIt is an honest face, keen, austere; a mocking jest might have passed\\nthe lips, but neither flatteries nor lies. His tastes were simple, his\\nlife was ever free from dissipation. In money matters he was regarded\\nas close, and the reproach has been made by some that he acted as a\\nBarnum towards his two precocious children. The reproach is unjust. The\\nman was poor. His earnings were small. He needed money to pay his debts\\nand support his family. But no specific charge of meanness or avarice\\nhas been substantiated. On the other hand he was scrupulously honest,\\nsincere in the duties of his profession, and of a profoundly religious\\nnature that was shown in profession and practice. At the same time he\\nwas not a bigot. He would not yield to the tyranny of priests; he was\\nfree from superstition of every sort; his sane spirit and his bitter wit\\nwere exercised in spiritual as well as temporal affairs. Grimm, who was\\nno mean judge of men, wrote of him as follows: \"The father is not only a\\nskilful musician, but a man of good sense and ready wit, and I have never\\nseen a man of his profession who was at the same time so talented and of\\nsuch sterling worth.\" As a musician he was thorough, well educated, and a\\ncomposer of merit. His treatise upon violin playing was known throughout\\nEurope, and it showed the solid qualities of the musician and the ironical\\ntemperament of the man. All of his gifts were used, however, chiefly in\\ndirecting and developing most wisely the extraordinary genius of the young\\nWolfgang. The affection shown him, however, was lavished equally upon his\\nwife and other children.\\n\\nSalzburg is a town renowned for its beauty. \"To see it shining in the sun,\\nwith its large white facades, its flat roofs, its terraces, its church and\\nconvent cupolas, its fountains, one would take it for an Italian city.\"\\nThe advantages of its natural situation and the artifical charms of the\\nplace were, if the opinion of the eighteenth century may be accepted,\\nonly equalled by the stupidity of the inhabitants. There was a German\\nproverb that ran as follows: \"He who comes to Salzburg grows foolish\\nthe first year, becomes an idiot the second; but it is not until the\\nthird year that he is a Salzburger.\" The German Harlequin _Hanswurst_,\\nhowever, was a Salzburg creation; and the inhabitants were fond of heavy\\nand coarse jokes. No wonder then that the town and the society were\\ndistasteful to Leopold Mozart. He left his birthplace to study law in\\nSalzburg; and in 1743 he entered the service of the Archbishop Sigismund,\\nas a court-musician. Later he became court-composer and leader of the\\norchestra; in 1762 he was second Kapellmeister. In 1747 he married Anna\\nMaria Pertl or Bertl. She was the daughter of the steward of a hospital.\\nShe was very beautiful, good natured, loving, and of limited education.\\nSeven children were born of this marriage. Five died at a very early age.\\nThe fourth, Maria Anna (born July 30, 1751), was familiarly known as\\n\"Nannerl,\" and she was a musical prodigy. The seventh and last was born\\nat eight o\\'clock in the evening, Jan. 27, 1756, and the mother nearly\\ndied in the child-bed. According to the certificate of baptism, he was\\nnamed Joannes-Chrysostomus-Wolfgangus-Theophilus. His first compositions\\npublished in Paris in 1764 are signed J. G. Wolfgang. Later works bear the\\nname Wolfgang Amade. In private life he was known as Wolfgang. Variations\\nsometimes found in the biographies come from the fact that Theophilus and\\nAmadeus and Gottlieb are but one and the same name.\\n\\nSchachtner, the court trumpeter, and a house-friend of the father,\\npreserved for us in a letter written to Mozart\\'s sister many interesting\\ndetails of the early manifestations of the boy\\'s genius. At the age of\\nthree he sought thirds upon the keys of the pianoforte. At the age of\\nfour his father began to teach him little pieces. When he was five he\\ndictated minuets to his father, which are of natural but correct harmony,\\nmelodious and even characteristic. The first of these minuets is given\\nherewith. These are not legends, but well attested facts. Four minuets and\\nan allegro have been published by Otto Jahn in the second edition of his\\n\"Mozart.\" Singular indeed are some of the stories related. Up to the age\\nof ten he could not endure the sound or sight of the trumpet. He wrote a\\npianoforte concerto, clearly conceived, but of unsurmountable difficulty,\\nwhen he was four. His sense of pitch was extraordinary. The father watched\\nthis astounding precocity with loving fear and prayed that he might be\\nwise enough to direct it.\\n\\n[Music: MOZART\\'S FIRST COMPOSITION.\\n\\nMinuet.]\\n\\n[Illustration: VIEW OF SALZBURG.\\n\\nFrom a photograph.]\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART IN HIS SIXTH YEAR.\\n\\nThe court dress was sent to him by the Empress Maria Theresa.

At Passau the children played before the Bishop, who\\nmarvelled greatly and gave the father a ducat. At Linz they gave their\\nfirst concert. They then descended the Danube to Vienna, stopping at the\\nmonastery of Ips, where Wolfgang played so effectively upon the organ that\\nthe Franciscan fathers left the dinner table that they might hear him;\\nwhich miracle is doubtless recorded in the annals of the abbey.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART IN HIS NINTH YEAR.\\n\\nOriginal in the Mozarteum, in Salzburg. On the bottom of the music--\"Th.\\nHelbling juv. pinx.\"]\\n\\nThe Austrian imperial family was passionately fond of music. Francis the\\nFirst was a distinguished connoisseur, and Maria Theresa was a pupil of\\nWagenseil, as well as an accomplished singer. The Mozart children were\\nreceived with open arms. The courtiers were astonished at the display of\\ngenius. The Emperor spent hours in testing and wondering at the powers of\\nWolfgang. The young Marie Antoinette romped with the boy who promised to\\nmarry her when he was old enough.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART IN HIS TENTH YEAR.\\n\\nPainted by Dominicus van der Smissen, 1766. The original in possession of\\nMr. R. Horner, in Ulm.]\\n\\nThe noble families of the town vied with each other in their attentions.\\nThe children were given money, court dresses, and tokens of genuine\\naffection, and the first portrait of Wolfgang was painted then in Vienna,\\nin which he has powdered hair, and he carries a sword. The boy was seized\\nwith scarlet fever in October, and in the beginning of 1763 Leopold went\\nback to Salzburg. But the 9th of June of the same year, with his wife and\\nchildren, he set out for Paris, having letters of credit from his good\\nfriend Haguenauer. They had adventures, and they gave concerts on the way.\\nThey arrived at Ludwigsburg, the Versailles of Stuttgart, where Jomelli,\\nwith his carriages and horses, houses and yearly salary of four thousand\\nflorins, brought to Leopold\\'s mind his own modest condition, and provoked\\nhim to bitter remarks. Frankfort, Bonn and Brussels were seen, and finally\\nthe family arrived in Paris the 18th of November. The story of this\\nvisit, as well as the visit of 1778, has been most entertainingly told by\\nJullien in the brochure \"Mozart a Paris,\" to which the reader is referred\\nfor interesting details. The letters of Leopold contain much curious\\ninformation about the musical condition of the city. Frederick Melchior\\nGrimm, who was regarded as an authority, exerted himself most actively\\nin the behalf of his compatriots. They were presented at Court; they were\\ncelebrated in prose and in verse; their portraits were painted; and four\\nsonatas \"pour le clavecin\" were engraved and published. In April, 1764,\\nLeopold left Paris for London, by Calais, Dover, and he took with him the\\nopinion that French music and French morals were detestable. In England\\nthe family were received most kindly by the King and the Queen, who, as\\nis well known, were passionate amateurs of music. The curiosity of the\\nLondoners to hear the children was great; the learned Daines Barrington\\nproved the genius of Wolfgang in many ways, and then made it the subject\\nof a letter preserved in the annals of the \"Philosophical Transactions\"\\nof the year 1770; and guineas chinked pleasantly together in Leopold\\'s\\npocket. Here Wolfgang wrote three symphonies, four according to Jahn and\\nKoechel, but Wilder gives good reasons for doubting the date of the one\\nin B-flat major. He also dedicated six sonatas for pianoforte and violin\\nor flute to the Queen. His London visit benefited his education. Pohl in\\nhis interesting and valuable \"Mozart in London\" gives a full account of\\nthe condition of music at the time. Wolfgang had an opportunity of hearing\\nHandel\\'s oratorios and Italian opera; he became intimate with Christian\\nBach; he heard the castrate Tenducci, the master of cantabile; he took\\nsinging lessons of the famous male soprano Manzuoli. In July 1765 Leopold\\nand the children started for the Hague; at Lille, Wolfgang was seriously\\nill, and at the Hague the sister was attacked by a violent fever. Wolfgang\\nwrote while in Holland six sonatas and other pieces. After passing through\\nParis and Swiss towns, the family arrived at Salzburg in November, 1766.\\nWolfgang was pleased at seeing again his favorite cat, and then under his\\nfather\\'s direction he began the study of the \"Gradus\" of Fux. In 1767 he\\nlearned Latin and set to Latin words a comedy, \"Apollo et Hyacinthus,\" at\\nthe instigation of the Archbishop, who had hitherto played the part of\\ndoubting Thomas. He also wrote four pianoforte concertos for his own use\\nin concerts.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART IN HIS FOURTEENTH YEAR.\\n\\nPainted in Verona, Jan. 6 and 7, 1770. Painter unknown.]\\n\\nLeopold was not blind to the fact that Italy was the home of great\\ncomposers and illustrious singers; that its atmosphere was stimulating\\nto musical thought; that its very name was synonymous with music. Under\\npretext of a short visit to Vienna, he made his excuses to the Archbishop\\nand started, in September, 1767, with his family on a longer journey. In\\nVienna, the children were seized with small-pox, and it was not until\\nJanuary, 1768, that they were able to enter into the musical life of the\\ntown. They heard Gluck\\'s \"Alceste,\" and Leopold preferred to it Hasse\\'s\\n\"Partenope.\" Joseph II., a man of frugal mind, demanded of Wolfgang\\nan opera for his theatre, and the boy wrote \"La Finta Simplice,\" an\\nopera-buffa in three acts. It won the unqualified praise of the singers\\nand such composers as Hasse, but the cabal against Wolfgang was too\\nstrong, and the opera was not given. \"Bastien und Bastienne,\" an opera in\\none act, was written immediately after, and produced with great applause\\nin the house of a Vienna doctor. (The pastoral theme of the instrumental\\nintroduction, the intrada, anticipates in a singular manner the opening of\\nBeethoven\\'s Third Symphony.) Wolfgang\\'s first mass was given in public,\\nand he himself directed. The Archbishop of Salzburg sent word to Leopold\\nthat his pay would continue only while he was actually in Salzburg, and so\\nthe family returned home. But the Italian journey was still in Leopold\\'s\\nhead, and hoping to pay the expenses of the trip by giving concerts, he\\nstarted out with Wolfgang in December, 1769. At Roveredo and Verona, the\\nenthusiasm of the people was unbounded; at Milan they met the generous Von\\nFirmian, who was the means of procuring a contract for Wolfgang to write\\nan opera for the Christmas holidays; at Bologna they became acquainted\\nwith Father Martini and Farinelli; at Florence, Wolfgang met his friend\\nManzuoli and Thomas Linley, the English violinist of his own age; and in\\nHoly Week they were at Rome, and they heard the Allegri _Miserere_. The\\nstory of the boy memorizing this famous composition at a hearing, writing\\nit out, and correcting it after a second hearing, is familiar to all.\\nThe feat provoked the wildest curiosity to see him, and he was looked\\nat superstitiously, just as, soon after, at Naples his virtuosoship was\\nattributed to a ring worn upon a finger of the left hand. The concerts\\nin these towns refilled the drained purse; in 1770, the pope ennobled\\nthe boy, giving him the cross of the Golden Spur; and he was received\\ninto the famous _accademia filarmonica_ of Bologna. Meanwhile Wolfgang\\nwas considering the opera promised for Milan, and the 26th of December,\\n1770, \"Mitridate, re di Ponto\" was produced and received with unbounded\\nenthusiasm. It was given twenty times, and the impresario hastened to make\\na new contract with the _cavaliere filarmonico_, as the Milanese called\\nhim. Father and son then visited Turin and Venice, and about this time\\nWolfgang probably wrote the oratorio \"Betulia liberata.\" In the spring\\nof 1771 they returned to Salzburg, where they found a letter from Count\\nFirmian asking for a pastorale to celebrate the wedding of the Archduke\\nFerdinand with the Princess Beatrice of Modena. And now the boy fell in\\nlove with a woman ten years his elder. She was betrothed to another, and\\nher marriage and Wolfgang\\'s return to Milan in August ended the affair.\\nAlthough in the house where he lodged, violinists, a singing teacher, and\\nan oboe player plied assiduously their business, Wolfgang finished the\\npromised composition, \"Ascanio in Alba\" in twelve days. It was first heard\\nOctober 17. Its success was so great that Hasse\\'s opera \"Ruggiero\" was\\nneglected; and the kindly veteran simply said, \"This young rascal will\\ncause us all to be forgotten.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: HOUSE IN SALZBURG WHERE MOZART WAS BORN.\\n\\nNo. 9 Getreidegasse.]\\n\\nAbout the time that Wolfgang returned home, December, 1771, Sigismund,\\nthe Archbishop, died, and Hieronymus ruled in his stead. He was a man\\nof mean and tyrannical spirit, and his reputation had preceded him, so\\nthat when he arrived in Salzburg he was received in gloomy silence.\\nNevertheless there were festivities, and Wolfgang wrote \"Il sogno di\\nScipione,\" a composition unworthy of his pen. It was in this same year,\\n1772, that Dr. Charles Burney received a letter from a correspondent,\\nsaying that the lad was still a pianoforte virtuoso of great merit, but\\nthat as a composer he had reached his limit; and the writer then moralized\\nover musical precocities, comparing them to premature fruits. Yet at\\nthis same epoch, Wolfgang wrote the celebrated Litany \"de venerabile.\"\\nIn November he visited Milan again to compose and put on the stage the\\nopera \"Lucio Silla.\" There were many obstacles before and even during the\\nrepresentation; but the success of the work was unquestioned. This was the\\nlast opera written by Wolfgang for Italy. The impresarios were willing\\nand eager; but the Archbishop was reluctant in granting even ordinary\\nfavors to his servant. And here is the end of the first period of Mozart\\'s\\nmusical career.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROOM IN WHICH MOZART WAS BORN.--No. 9 GETREIDEGASSE,\\nSALZBURG,--THIRD FLOOR.\\n\\nThis and an adjoining room form at present the Mozart-Museum in which are\\ndeposited all original family pictures, busts, autographs, compositions,\\nletters, etc. Also, the spinet and grand piano used by Mozart in his later\\nyears.]\\n\\nThe next five years were passed without material change in the\\ncircumstances of the family. There was a trip to Vienna during the absence\\nof Hieronymus; and in December, 1774, Wolfgang, having obtained permission\\nfrom the Archbishop, who did not dare to offend the Elector of Bavaria,\\nwent to Munich to write or to finish and bring out an opera-buffa, \"La\\nfinta giardiniera,\" which had been ordered by Maximilian III., who in\\nearlier years was much interested in the child. The opera was produced\\nwith brilliant success, Jan. 13, 1775, and his dear sister was present\\nto share in the joy of the composer. After Mozart\\'s return to Salzburg,\\nHieronymus received a visit from the Archduke Maximilian, the brother of\\nMarie Antoinette. It no doubt occurred to him that one of his servants,\\nwho was paid, by the way, about $5.50 a month, was not earning his wages;\\nand so Mozart was requested to write an opera, \"II re Pastore,\" in honor\\nof the imperial guest. This was performed in April, 1775, and this year\\nand the next were years of great fertility: music for the church, violin\\nconcertos, divertimenti, serenades, organ sonatas, etc. He worked at the\\nviolin to please his father, who had a high opinion of his ability in this\\ndirection; and besides, one of his duties was to play at the court, a\\nduty that he detested. In spite of all this work, these days in Salzburg\\ndragged along, sad and monotonous. The social life of the town was slow\\nand stupid. Risbeck and other travelers have given us curious details.\\n\"The sovereign,\" writes one, \"goes a-hunting and to church; the nobles go\\nto church and hunt; the tradespeople eat, drink and pray; the rest pray,\\ndrink and eat.\" No wonder that he shot sarcastic arrows at his fellow\\ntownsmen. He poked fun at a lover of his sister who gaped at everything he\\nsaw in Munich, \"so that one could easily tell he had only seen Salzburg\\nand Innsbruck.\" He was never tired of telling of a Salzburgian who\\ncomplained that he could not judge Paris satisfactorily, \"as the houses\\nwere too high and shut off the horizon.\" \"I detest Salzburg and everything\\nthat is born in it. The tone and the manners of the people are utterly\\nunsupportable.\" He avoided society. Sundays, to be sure, with a few of his\\nown age, he played at pea-shooting; and he was fond of going occasionally\\nto balls. Nor did he associate willingly with the musicians. His father\\nhated the Italians in the orchestra; and the German musicians were so\\nfond of their cups that when Leopold went to Mannheim he was surprised at\\nthe sobriety of the orchestra. He spent most of his time at home, fond\\nof a canary bird and a dog, teasing his sister about her lovers, adoring\\nhis father and mother. Finally the father and son plucked up courage and\\nasked Hieronymus for a leave of absence. It was refused, with the remark\\nthat he did not wish one of his servants going about begging from town\\nto town. With his father\\'s permission Wolfgang then sent a letter asking\\nfor his dismission. The vanity of the archbishop was hurt, and he was\\nfuriously angry; \"After all,\" he said, \"it is only one musician the less.\"\\nAs Leopold could not leave the town, he confided his son to the protection\\nof the mother, and after a sorrowful leave-taking the two started on their\\njourney Sept. 23, 1777. In the anxiety of the moment, the father forgot to\\ngive the boy his blessing.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART\\'S FAVORITE CONCERT PIANO, AND SPINET OR SMALL\\nCLAVICHORD, now on exhibition at the Mozarteum, in Salzburg.\\n\\nThe piano was used by Mozart during the last ten years of his life. It has\\nfive octaves and was made by the celebrated Anton Walter. Its value was\\nestimated, after Mozart\\'s death, at 80 florins (about $25) and it probably\\nsold for less. It came into the possession of Hummel, the composer and\\npianist, and finally to the Mozarteum.\\n\\nThe spinet has five octaves and was used in composing the Magic Flute,\\nTitus and The Requiem.\\n\\nIn the background is seen the large painting of the Mozart family, by\\nCarmontelle.]\\n\\nAnd now began the struggles of his life, struggles that only ended with\\na premature death. They went first to Munich, but there was nothing\\nthere. The intendant of the theatre, a broker in music, would not accept\\nWolfgang\\'s proposition to furnish four operas a year for a ridiculously\\nsmall sum of money; and there was no other opening. Then a visit was made\\nto Wolfgang\\'s uncle in Augsburg. Here he was kindly received. He became\\nintimate with Stein, the instrument-maker, and gave pianoforte lessons to\\nhis daughter. He swore lasting fidelity to his own cousin. When he left,\\nthere was an exchange of portraits, and afterward the cousins corresponded\\nvigorously for a time. The next stopping place was Mannheim, which was\\ncalled \"the paradise of musicians.\" The orchestra fostered by the musical\\nElector Karl Theodore was probably without a rival in Europe. It was\\nof unusual size. There were eleven first violins, eleven second, four\\nviolas, four \\'cellos, and four double basses; two flutes, two oboes,\\ntwo clarinets (instruments rarely used in those days), four bassoons,\\ntwo horns, and trumpets and drums. The conductor was Cannabich, a man of\\nknowledge and of temperament. The performances of this orchestra were\\ncelebrated by all the critics of the time. Burney compared the _piano_\\nand _forte_ to different colors used by painters. Schubart wrote that the\\n_forte_ was a thunder-storm, the _crescendo_ a cataract, the _diminuendo_\\nlike the purling of a crystal stream, the _piano_ like a breath of spring.\\nAnd Burney, again, compared the orchestra to an army of generals equally\\nprepared to direct the campaign and to fight. With these men Mozart\\nbecame intimate. Here also he knew the famous singers, Dorothea Wendling,\\nFranciska Danzi and Anton Raaff. Here too he met the famous Abbe Vogler,\\nthe teacher in future years of Weber and Meyerbeer, whom he disliked to\\nthe point of hatred. He sneered at his theoretical books, he called him\\n\"charlatan\" and \"humbug.\" A harsh verdict, and one not fully deserved,\\nalthough this Vogler was truly an eccentric person, who boasted that he\\ncould make a composer in three weeks and a singer in six months. Now,\\ncertain members of the orchestra were engaged for concerts in Paris, and\\nthey begged Mozart to go with them, saying that Paris was the only town\\nwhere such a composer would be appreciated and could make his fortune.\\nAt first he embraced their views and tried to convince his father that\\nthe plan was for the best. When everything seemed favorable, Leopold was\\nastonished by the receipt of letters from Wolfgang, saying that he had\\nabandoned the project, and at the same time giving ridiculous reasons for\\nthe change. The truth was that the boy was in love.\\n\\nFridolin Weber, a man of good family and of education, was the prompter\\nand the copyist of the Mannheim theatre. Poor as he was, he had cultivated\\nthe talents of his daughters. They were five in number. The second,\\nAloysia, was fifteen, distinguished for her beauty and superb voice. She\\nand Mozart went together to the chateau of the Princess of Orange,--and\\nthey loved each other. She sang for the Princess and he played, and the\\nletters written by Wolfgang to his father show more than a musician\\'s\\ninterest in Aloysia. For her he wrote a passionate aria, choosing\\nMetastasio\\'s lines \"Non so d\\'onde.\" This love making was stopped by a\\nsensible and kindly letter from Leopold, and the boy and his mother set\\nout for Paris. There were tears, and presents. Aloysia gave her lover two\\npairs of mittens which she had worked, and Fridolin added a roll of music\\npaper and a copy of Moliere. But Aloysia was piqued and never forgave\\nWolfgang for his obedience to his father.\\n\\n[Illustration: MARIA ANNA MOZART,\\n\\nSister of the composer and remarkable as a musical prodigy. This portrait\\nis idealized, being a reproduction from the Bruckmann collection.]\\n\\nAfter a journey of nine days, mother and son arrived in Paris, the 23d\\nof March, 1778. Mozart, sick at heart, looked upon the gay scenes with\\ndisapproving eyes. Even a month after his arrival, he wrote his father\\nthat he was indifferent to all things and that nothing interested him. His\\nroom was gloomy, and so small that he could not get a pianoforte between\\nthe two cots. However he lost no time in calling upon Grimm and the\\nMannheim friends. He met Legros, the director of the \"Concert spirituel,\"\\nwho gave him work, and Noverre, the celebrated ballet-master, and for him\\nhe wrote music for a ballet-pantomime called \"Les Petits Riens,\" which was\\nproduced at the Opera house June 11, 1778. It was preceded by an opera\\nof Piccini and ascribed to Noverre. The \"demoiselle Asselin\" was praised\\nby the journals, and nothing was said about the music. The manuscript was\\ndiscovered by Victor Wilder, and the ballet was played during the winter\\nof 1872-73 at a concert at the Grand Hotel, Paris. A few days after the\\nfirst performance of this ballet, Mozart\\'s \"Paris\" Symphony was played in\\nthe hall of the Tuileries and with success. A second symphony, played in\\nSeptember, has disappeared.\\n\\nAlthough in many ways this visit to Paris was a sore disappointment to\\nMozart, and although he wrote bitterly about the condition of music in the\\nFrench capital, his stay was of great and beneficial influence upon his\\ncareer. He heard the operas of Gluck, Gretry, Monsigny, Philidor and the\\nItalians who then disputed the supremacy with the French. In after years\\nhe was found surrounded by the works of Gluck and Gretry, and when asked\\nif the study of Italian masters was not more profitable, he replied: \"Yes,\\nas regards melody; but not for true and dramatic expression.\"\\n\\nIn May, 1778, the mother of Mozart sickened, and in July she died after\\nmuch suffering. She was stout and subject to apoplectic attacks. As she\\nhad no confidence in French physicians, she was attended by an elderly\\nGerman who was more patriotic than learned. He gave her rhubarb and wine,\\nagainst Mozart\\'s wishes, and when Grimm\\'s doctor arrived it was too late\\nfor cure. She was buried probably in the cemetery of the Innocents, which\\nwas destroyed in 1785.\\n\\nThe grief of the son was terrible, and the father was uneasy. Grimm,\\nwho was now wholly interested in Italian music sung by Italians,\\nadvised Leopold to recall Wolfgang. The archbishop of Salzburg held out\\ninducements to father and son. The father at last commanded the return,\\nand in September, 1778, the philosopher Grimm accompanied the young\\nmusician to the diligence and paid his way to Strasburg. When Wolfgang\\nfinally saw that his return was unavoidable, he complained bitterly. \"I\\nhave committed the greatest folly in the world. With a little patience I\\nshould surely have won in France a glorious reputation and a substantial\\nincome.\"\\n\\nKarl Theodore of Mannheim was now elector of Bavaria. He took his court\\nto Munich, and Aloysia Weber sang in his theatre. Mozart stopped to see\\nher. She was slow to recognize him, and she did not approve of the black\\nbuttons on his red coat, the French fashion of mourning dress. But he\\nwrote a grand aria for her, and even after her marriage to the play-actor\\nLange he confessed to his father that he still cared for her.\\n\\nIt was in January, 1779, that Mozart again saw Salzburg, and for a year\\nand a half he stayed there working steadily. His illusions were gone; his\\nheart was sad. He loathed the town. \"When I play in Salzburg, or when any\\nof my compositions are performed, the audience might as well be chairs or\\ntables.\" But he found some relief in work, and among the many compositions\\nof this period is the incidental music to \"Konig Thamos,\" an Egyptian\\ndrama. He also wrote an opera, \"Zaide,\" which he abandoned, and which was\\nbrought out in Frankfort in 1866. In 1780 he received a commission from\\nKarl Theodore to compose an opera for the Munich carnival of the following\\nyear. The text was written by an Italian priest named Varesco, and it told\\nthe story of Idomeneus, king of Crete, a story that is closely allied to\\nthe famous adventure of Jephtha. In November Mozart went to Munich and\\nhe was graciously received. His letters tell of the usual differences\\nthat come up between composer and singers, and his father gave him good\\nadvice: \"You know that there are an hundred ignorant people for every ten\\ntrue connoisseurs; so do not forget what is called popular, and tickle\\nthe long ears.\" The rehearsals gave great satisfaction and the Elector\\nremarked: \"No one would imagine that such great things could come out of\\nsuch a little head.\" The opera was given January 29, 1781, and the Munich\\nNews praised the scenery \"of our well-known theatrical architect, the Herr\\nCouncillor Lorenz Quaglio.\" It is not known how much Mozart received in\\npayment.\\n\\nThe Archbishop had only given leave of absence for six weeks; but Mozart\\nliked Munich and hated to return. He wrote church and instrumental pieces\\nfor the Elector, and enjoyed the gay life, until in March the Archbishop,\\nwho went to Vienna after the death of the Empress, summoned him. \"And\\nthere his destiny was to be fulfilled.\"\\n\\nThe Archbishop was in execrable humor. Joseph II. was not fond of priests,\\nand he had greeted him coolly. The wrath of Hieronymous was poured out on\\nthe composer\\'s head, for he had not forgotten or forgiven Mozart\\'s brusque\\ndeparture, and he could not endure his independent spirit. He made him\\neat with the servants. He would not allow him to play the pianoforte at\\na concert given for the benefit of the widows and orphans of musicians;\\nand when he was forced into giving him permission, he hated him the more.\\nHe ordered him to be present every morning in an antechamber to receive\\norders; and when Mozart rebelled, he forgot his sacred calling and abused\\nhim indecently; \"black-guard, regular ass, idiot, dirty rascal,\" were\\nthe mildest of the reproaches. He showed him the door, and Mozart, who\\nhad kept his temper, said that if His Grace wished it, he would be only\\ntoo willing to resign; and he wrote his father that his prospects in\\nVienna were bright and that he could not bear the thought of returning to\\nSalzburg and continual humiliation. His success as a pianoforte player\\nat the charitable concert was such that many desired to take lessons of\\nhim, in spite of the price demanded by him--six ducats for twelve lessons.\\n\"Thanks be to my pupils, I have as much as I want; but I will not have\\nmany pupils; I prefer few, and to be better paid than other teachers.\"\\nHe protests as follows: \"If I were offered two thousand florins by the\\nArchbishop, and only one thousand florins in any other place, I should\\ngo to the other place; for instead of the other one thousand florins I\\nshould enjoy health and contentment of mind.\" But Leopold Mozart was not\\nthe man of former days; he was nervous and almost hypochondriacal. He\\nhad heard that his son was living a dissipated life; and he understood\\nthat he was neglecting his religious duties; it even grieved him to\\nthink that Wolfgang ate meat on fast-days. Nor did he approve of the\\nrenewed intercourse with the Weber family, for Aloysia was now married to\\nLange, \"a jealous fool,\" and the mother and daughters were in Vienna. In\\nJune, 1781, young Mozart determined to procure from the Archbishop his\\ndismission, as he heard that the departure to Salzburg was near at hand.\\nHe found in the antechamber Count Arco ready to receive him. There were\\nviolent words, and finally Arco kicked him out of the room. And thus was\\nMozart set free.\\n\\n[Illustration: ALOYSIA WEBER, sister to Mozart\\'s wife, and her husband\\nJOS. LANGE, actor and painter.\\n\\nFrom the first volume of \"Die Ephemeriden der Litteratur und des\\nTheaters.\" Berlin, 1785. Drawn by Lange himself. We owe to him the last\\nportrait of Mozart.]\\n\\nIt was summer, the nobility had gone to their country seats, and there\\nwere few lessons and few concerts. Mozart worked at pianoforte sonatas\\nand dreamed of an opera. Josephine Aurnhammer, remarkably fat, ugly, and\\nan excellent pianist, fell in love with him, and he was therefore obliged\\nto gradually break off his acquaintance with the \"sentimental mastodon.\"\\nIn December Clementi came to Vienna, and he and Mozart played before the\\nEmperor. Mozart was proclaimed victor, and the Emperor gave him fifty\\nducats and saw in him the man to assist him in founding the lyric German\\ndrama. Stephanie, the inspector of the opera, had provided the text\\nof \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail\" (The Escape from the Seraglio) and\\nMozart had already written much of the music before Clementi\\'s visit. In\\na letter to his father he describes the work of a day. \"At six o\\'clock\\nmy hair-dresser awakes me; by seven I am shaven, curled, and dressed; I\\ncompose until nine, and then give lessons until one; I then dine alone,\\nunless I am invited to some great house, in which case my dinner is put\\noff until two or three; then I work again about five or six, unless\\nI go to a concert, in which case I work after my return until one in\\nthe morning.\" In July (the 13th or the 16th, for there is a dispute\\nconcerning the date), 1782, \"The Escape from the Seraglio\" was given. The\\nhouse was crammed, there was no end to the applause and cheering, and\\nperformances followed one another in quick succession. The German opera\\nwas established; but the Emperor Joseph only said, \"Too fine for our ears,\\nand too many notes.\" Mozart replied, \"Just as many notes as are necessary,\\nyour Majesty.\" It was in this opera, according to Carl Maria von Weber,\\nthat Mozart arrived at the full maturity of his genius.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART\\'S WIFE.\\n\\nConstanze Weber. From a woodcut by A. Neumann, after a photograph from an\\naquarelle painting on ivory, in the Mozarteum, in Salzburg.]\\n\\nThe 4th of August, 1782, Mozart married Constanze Weber, before the\\narrival of his father\\'s formal consent. He had been in love with her for\\nsome months, and in December of the year before he had written his father\\nabout her. \"She is the martyr of the family.... She looks after everything\\nin the house, and yet can never do right. She is not ugly, but she is far\\nfrom being beautiful. Her whole beauty consists in her dark eyes and good\\nfigure. She is not intellectual, but she has common sense enough to fulfil\\nher duties as a wife and mother. She is not inclined to extravagance;\\non the contrary, she is always badly dressed, for the little her mother\\ncan do is done for the two others, never for her. True, she likes to be\\nneat and clean, but not smart; and almost all that a woman needs she can\\nmake for herself; she understands housekeeping, has the best heart in the\\nworld--she loves me and I love her--tell me if I could wish for a better\\nwife?\" The father was sorely vexed. He saw poverty and \"starving brats.\"\\nHe disapproved of the Weber family. With reluctance he finally sent the\\nparental blessing. The wedding was simple, and the supper was given by\\nthe Baroness von Waldstadten, a famous pianist, and a woman of unsavory\\nreputation. The income of the newly-married couple was precarious and\\nuncertain, and so it was until the divorce of death, but man and wife were\\nvery happy. They were young--Mozart was twenty-six and Constanze was about\\neighteen--and they took no thought of the morrow. The morning after the\\nwedding the Abbe Stadler called upon them, and he was asked to breakfast.\\nConstanze in her marriage dress made the fire and prepared the coffee,\\nand with laughter they thus began their married life, without money and\\nwith a carelessness that bordered on recklessness. To Constanze even this\\npinched life was a relief, for she had long suffered from the intolerance\\nof a drunken mother. Mozart\\'s love for his wife was town talk. Kelly,\\nthe English tenor, in later years, spoke of \"the passionate love\" of the\\ncomposer. He told her everything, even his faults and sins, and she was\\never tender and faithful. She was not unmusical; in fact she played and\\nsang, and was especially fond of fugues. She told him stories while he\\nworked. She cut his meat for him at table. As she was not robust, he, in\\nturn, was most careful of her health, and often denied himself that she\\nmight be more comfortable. There are German romances in existence that\\ndeal with alleged love episodes in the life of Mozart, and in which he is\\nrepresented as often unfaithful to his wife. Grave historians have not\\nthought it an unworthy task to examine the current scandals of his life in\\nVienna. It is true that the manners and customs of the Viennese were free\\nand easy. It was an age of gallantry. It is not improbable that he was\\nexposed to many temptations. At the same time the looseness of his life\\nwas grossly exaggerated, and specific charges that were made are now known\\nto be legends. Hummel, who lived in Mozart\\'s house as a pupil, wrote in\\n1831: \"I declare it to be untrue that Mozart abandoned himself to excess,\\nexcept on those rare occasions when he was enticed by Schikaneder.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: THE MOZART FAMILY.\\n\\n    C. de Carmontelle del.      Delafosse, Sculp. 1764.\\n]\\n\\nDiscouraged by the parsimony of the Emperor, failing in his endeavor to\\nbecome the teacher of the Princess Elizabeth, and believing himself to\\nbe unappreciated, Mozart determined to leave Vienna and turned towards\\nFrance and England. At this time he was chiefly known in Vienna as a\\npianoforte player. It was not until the appearance of the \"Magic Flute\"\\nthat he was recognized there as a great operatic composer, and then it was\\ntoo late. The father, however, opposed the plans of his son, and he even\\nwrote to the Baroness von Waldstadten urging her to reason with Wolfgang,\\nand adding, \"What is there to prevent his having a prosperous career in\\nVienna, if only he has a little patience?\" And so Mozart stayed in Vienna.\\nHe gave lessons, which were apt to be of a desultory nature. He gave\\nconcerts in the Augarten which was frequented by the fashionable people.\\nHe gave concerts in the theatre and in different halls, and his own music\\nwas performed with great success. His concertos and his playing were\\ncheered to the echo by the Emperor and the nobility. His old love Aloysia\\nsang at one of these concerts, and Gluck sat in a box and applauded. It is\\nnot true that at this time Mozart was unappreciated by the public or that\\nthe public was not willing to pay money for the pleasure of hearing him.\\nAs a pianoforte player he was surfeited with applause. His subscription\\nconcerts were crowded. At one he received four hundred and fifty ducats;\\nat two concerts in Prague in 1786 he received one thousand florins. He\\nplayed regularly in private concerts given by members of the nobility,\\nand it was the custom of the Viennese aristocracy to reward distinguished\\nartists liberally. On the other hand he made but little by the publication\\nof his compositions. Nor did he fare better in his dealings with\\ntheatrical managers. The usual payment in Vienna for an opera was one\\nhundred ducats. Upon the whole, Mozart was probably as well treated from a\\npecuniary point of view as the majority of the musicians of his time. He\\nhad no head for business, and he was constantly in want of money. A few\\nmonths after his marriage he was threatened with an action for non-payment\\nof a bill. He was constantly borrowing small sums from Peter to pay Paul.\\nHis letters abound in proofs of his embarrassments. At different times he\\ntried plans of reform; from March, 1784, until February, 1785, he kept an\\naccount book, and the entries were neatly written. But Constanze was not\\nthe housewife praised by King Lemuel.\\n\\nA son was born in 1783, who died in the same year, and in the summer a\\nvisit was paid to Salzburg. A mass, which Mozart had vowed in his heart\\nbefore his marriage if he succeeded in taking Constanze there as his wife,\\nwas performed; he wrote duets for violin and viola to help Michael Haydn,\\nwho was prevented by sickness from satisfying the Archbishop\\'s command;\\nhe sketched a part of an opera, \"L\\'Oca del Cairo.\" In one way the visit\\nwas a disappointment. Neither Leopold nor Marianna was really fond of\\nConstanze, and Mozart was displeased because none of the trinkets that\\nhad been given him in his youth were offered to his wife. He returned to\\nVienna in October. In 1785 the father returned the visit. He wept for\\njoy at hearing Wolfgang play the pianoforte concerto composed for the\\nblind pianist, Marie Paradies; he heard string quartets of his son played\\nby Haydn, Dittersdorf, Wolfgang and Vanhall; and Haydn said to him, \"I\\nassure you solemnly and as an honest man, that I consider your son to be\\nthe greatest composer of whom I have ever heard.\" Influenced by his son\\nhe became a Freemason. There were secret associations, brotherhoods of\\nall descriptions, more or less closely allied to Freemasonry, throughout\\nGermany during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Many wished\\nto join together in fighting for liberty of conscience and independence\\nof thought; and, as Herder, Wieland, Goethe, they saw in Freemasonry \"a\\nmeans of attaining their highest endeavors after universal good.\" In\\nVienna nearly all the distinguished leaders of thought were Freemasons;\\nthe lodges were fashionable, and in 1785 the Emperor Joseph placed them\\nunder the protection of the state, although he first reduced the number.\\nIt is not surprising that Mozart, with his love for humanity, his warm\\nsympathies for all that is good and noble, should enter eagerly into\\nmasonic ties and duties. He contemplated the founding of a secret society\\nof his own. His lodge was the oldest in Vienna, \"Zur gekronten Hoffnung,\"\\nand for this lodge he wrote vocal and instrumental works, one of which,\\nthe \"Trauermusik\" is of great beauty and originality.\\n\\nIn 1784 the German opera in Vienna was almost extinct. Aloysia Lange\\nchose Mozart\\'s \"Escape from the Seraglio\" for her benefit, and the\\ncomposer directed it; Gluck\\'s \"Pilgrimme von Mekka\" was given, as well\\nas Benda\\'s melodramas. The next year it was proposed to reinstate German\\nopera in competition with the Italian, and the scheme was carried out,\\nbut the performances were not equal to those of the Italian opera, and\\nMozart was not pitted by the Emperor as a native composer against the\\nforeigner Salieri. For a festival in 1786 dramatic performances were\\nordered in Italian and German, and Mozart wrote the music for \"Der\\nSchauspieldirector\" (The Theatre Director), while Salieri was more\\nfortunate in his text. The Italian operas were popular with the court\\nand the people, and the better singers went over to the Italian side.\\nPaesiello and Sarti were welcomed heartily in Vienna, and their operas\\nreceived the patronage of the Emperor. Mozart\\'s prospects as an operatic\\ncomposer were gloomy, until in 1785 he was seriously benefited by his\\nacquaintance with Lorenzo da Ponte, abbe, poet, and rake. This singular\\nman was appointed theatrical poet by Joseph II. through the influence\\nof Salieri. He quarreled with his benefactor, who engaged a rival as\\nhis librettist. Da Ponte looked about for a composer with whom he could\\njoin against his enemies, and he entered into negotiations with Mozart.\\nBeaumarchais\\' comedy, \"Le Mariage de Figaro,\" had finally been put on the\\nstage of the Theatre-Francais in April, 1784; it was exciting popular\\nattention; and Mozart wished an adaptation for his music. The adaptation\\nwould be an easy task, but the comedy itself was not allowed in the Vienna\\nTheatre. The poet was in the good graces of the Emperor and he confided\\nthe plan to him. Joseph admitted that Mozart was a good instrumental\\ncomposer, said that his opera did not amount to much, called Mozart to\\nhim, heard portions of the work, and ordered that it should be put into\\nrehearsal immediately. If we believe the account given by Da Ponte, the\\nwhole opera was finished in six weeks. There was a strong cabal, with\\nSalieri at the head, against the production, but it was brought out May\\n1st and with overwhelming success. Michael Kelly, who sang the parts of\\n_Basilio_ and _Don Curzio_, gives interesting accounts of the rehearsals\\nand the performance in his \"Reminiscences.\" \"Never was anything more\\ncomplete than the triumph of Mozart.\" At the second performance five\\npieces were repeated: at the third, seven; \"one little duet had to be\\nsung three times,\" we learn from a letter of Leopold Mozart. In November\\nMartin\\'s \"Cosa Rara\" pleased \"the fickle public\" mightily, and during\\n1787 and 1788 \"Figaro\" was not given. It was first performed in Berlin,\\nSept. 14, 1790: the critics praised it: the people preferred Martin and\\nDittersdorf. It was heard later in all the great towns of Europe (Paris,\\n1793; London, 1812, with Catalani as _Susanna_); in Prague it was heard at\\nonce and with the greatest success, and this led to \"Don Giovanni.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: THE MOZART FAMILY.\\n\\nLarge oil painting by de la Croce (born 1736, a pupil of Lorenzoni),\\npainted in 1780. The original is in the Salzburg Mozarteum and seems to\\nhave been repeatedly and unskilfully retouched.]\\n\\nThe success of \"Figaro\" was not of material benefit to Mozart in Vienna.\\nHe fretted at the necessity of teaching; he envied Gyrowetz, who went to\\nItaly. In 1786, a third child was born to him, Leopold, who died in the\\nspring of the next year. His English friends urged him to go to England.\\nHe thought seriously of doing this, when he received one day a letter from\\nthe orchestra of Prague, to which the leading connoisseurs and amateurs\\nhad added their names, begging him to visit the town and see for himself\\nthe enormous success of \"Figaro.\" Bohemia was a musical country, and at\\nthe capital music was cultivated passionately. There was an excellent\\nschool where pupils of talent were educated by the support of patrons.\\nThe members of the nobility had their orchestras, and some demanded that\\ntheir servants should be musicians. \"Figaro\" was played by the Bondini\\nItalian company throughout the winter of 1786-7, and the public enthusiasm\\nwas unbounded. The opera was turned into chamber music. It was arranged\\nfor all combinations of instruments. It was sung in the streets; it was\\nwhistled at street corners. Mozart with his wife arrived in Prague in\\nJanuary, 1787, and they were entertained by Count Thun. His visit was one\\nof unalloyed happiness. He saw the beauties of Prague \"hopping about to\\nthe music of \\'Figaro\\' turned into waltzes and country dances. The people\\ntalked of nothing but \\'Figaro.\\'\" In the theatre he was welcomed with\\nuproarious applause. His two concerts were in every way successful. And\\nhere he amused himself, doing little work, until Bondini made a contract\\nwith him by which Mozart agreed to give him an opera for the next season\\nfor one hundred ducats.\\n\\nNaturally he thought at once of Da Ponte, and Da Ponte suggested the\\nlegend of Don Juan Tenorio y Salazar, Lord of Albarren and Count of\\nMarana. This story had already attracted the attention of mask-makers and\\ncomedy-writers innumerable, among them Moliere, Shadwell, Goldoni; and\\nGluck and Righini, Tritto and Gazzaniga had set it to music, as ballet,\\n_dramma tragicomico, or opera buffa_. Da Ponte had made his fortune by the\\ntext of \"Figaro,\" and when he began the libretto for Mozart he was also at\\nwork on texts for Martin and Salieri. He went from one story to the other,\\nwith snuff-box and bottle of tokay before him, and the pretty daughter of\\nhis hostess by his side. \"Don Giovanni\" and Martin\\'s \"L\\'Arbore di Diana\"\\nwere finished in sixty-three days. We know little or nothing of Mozart\\'s\\nmethods in writing the music of the work. His thematic catalogue shows\\nthat from March till September few other important works were written, and\\nthe greatest of these are the string quintets in C major and G minor. His\\nfather died in May, and Mozart\\'s grief may well be imagined. \"Next to God\\nis papa\" showed the depth of his love. In September Mozart took his wife\\nand boy to Prague. He worked in the vineyard of his old friend Duschek,\\nand his friends talked or played at bowls. German essayists and novelists\\ninvented many stories, which reflect with discredit upon Mozart\\'s morality\\nduring this visit to Prague, and these stories, without real foundation,\\nwere for a long time accepted as facts. He is said, for instance, to\\nhave been violently in love with the women who sang at the theatre; and\\ncontinual intoxication is the mildest charge brought against him. Teresa\\nSaporiti, the \"Donna Anna,\" said when she first saw him, \"This illustrious\\nman has a most insignificant face,\" and yet their amorous adventures were\\nlong taken for granted. Nor do we know whether the many traditions are\\nonly traditions; such as his writing \"_La ci darem_\" five times before he\\ncould satisfy the singers; Bassi\\'s anger, and other tales. The overture\\nwas unwritten the very evening before the day of performance. His wife\\nmixed punch for him and told him stories, \"Cinderella,\" \"Aladdin\" and\\ntales of wonder and enchantment. Little by little, he grew sleepy as he\\nworked. The head would droop in spite of the efforts of Scheherazade. At\\nlast he rested on the sofa, and at five o\\'clock Constanze aroused him.\\nThe copyist came at seven; and the orchestra played the overture at sight\\nfrom wet sheets when October 29, 1787, \"Don Giovanni\" was first heard\\nby an enthusiastic public. The opera was an unqualified success. Mozart\\nstayed in Prague long enough to write a concert aria for Madame Duschek,\\nalthough she was obliged to lock him in a summer-house to get it; shortly\\nafter his return to Vienna Gluck died, and December 7th he was appointed\\nChamber Musician by Joseph. \"Don Giovanni\" was not given in Vienna until\\nMay 7, 1788, and it was a failure. The Emperor is reported to have said,\\n\"The opera is divine, perhaps even more beautiful than \\'Figaro,\\' but it\\nwill try the teeth of my Viennese.\" And Mozart said, \"We will give them\\ntime to chew it.\" It was first given in Berlin, Dec. 20, 1790; Paris,\\n1805, in a wretched version; London, in April, 1817. In 1825 Garcia,\\nwith his daughters, was in New York; he met Da Ponte there, and at the\\nsuggestion of the latter \"Don Giovanni\" was given. After it had made its\\nway in Germany, it was regarded as his masterpiece, and Mozart is reported\\nto have said that he wrote it not at all for Vienna, a little for Prague,\\nbut mostly for himself and friends.\\n\\n[Illustration: BRONZE STATUE OF MOZART, IN THE LUXEMBOURG.\\n\\nBy the Sculptor Barrias.]\\n\\nBut the opera did not help him pecuniarily. He was in constant need\\nof money. He was not idle, however; the great symphonies in E-flat\\nmajor, G minor and C major were written in the summer months of 1788;\\nhe prepared the music for the masked balls; he wrote compositions for\\nthe pleasure of his pupils; and, at the instigation of Van Swieten, who\\nwas an enthusiastic admirer of Handel, he prepared \"Acis and Galatea,\"\\n\"The Messiah,\" \"Ode for St. Cecilia\\'s Day,\" and \"Alexander\\'s Feast\" for\\nperformance by strengthening the instrumentation. He also directed them\\n(1788-1790). In 1789 he was invited by Prince Lichnowsky to visit him in\\nBerlin; he gladly accepted the invitation, thinking he might better his\\ncondition. They stopped at Prague; at Dresden, where he played before the\\nCourt, and at Leipsic, where he played the organ and heard a Bach motet.\\nAt Potsdam Mozart was presented to the King, Frederick William II., who\\nwas an enlightened patron of music. He played upon the \\'cello and was a\\nman of very catholic taste. The opera stage was free to Italian, French\\nand German composers. The orchestra in which the king often played at\\nrehearsals was directed by Duport; the opera by Reichardt, the musician\\nand journalist. Neither of these men looked upon Mozart\\'s appearance in\\nBerlin with favor, and they were none the sweeter to him when he replied\\nto the King\\'s question concerning the performances of the orchestra: \"It\\ncontains the best virtuosos, but if the gentlemen would play together,\\nit would be an improvement.\" The King offered him the position of\\nKapellmeister, at a salary of three thousand thalers; but Mozart would not\\nleave his Emperor. He made a short visit to Leipsic for a benefit concert\\nwhich hardly paid the expenses of the journey. On his return to Berlin\\nhe heard his \"Seraglio.\" In a certain passage, the second violins played\\nD sharp instead of D, and Mozart cried out angrily, \"Damn it, play D,\\nwill you?\" And here it is reported that he became enamored of Henriette\\nBaranius, a singer of remarkable beauty. The boy Hummel, his pupil,\\ngave a concert in Berlin, and was overjoyed to see him in the audience.\\nJust before Mozart\\'s departure in May, the King sent him one hundred\\nfriedrichsdor, and wished that he would write quartets for him. Constanze\\nreceived a letter in which her husband said that she must be glad to see\\nhim, not the money he brought.\\n\\nIn June, 1789, Mozart worked at the quartets promised to the King. He\\nfurnished the one in D major in a month, and received a gold snuff-box\\nwith one hundred friedrichsdor. But he was poor, in debt, his wife was\\noften sick, and he wrote in July that he was most unhappy. In December\\nhe worked busily on an opera, \"Cosi fan tutte,\" which the Emperor had\\nrequested, and Jan. 26, 1780, it was produced with success, although it\\nwas not often given. Joseph II. died the 20th of February, and Leopold II.\\nreigned in his stead. Mozart could expect but little of him, and when King\\nFerdinand of Naples visited Vienna in September, the greatest virtuoso of\\nthe town was not asked to play before him, although the royal visitor was\\npassionately fond of music. Meanwhile his expenses were increasing, his\\npupils falling off. In September he pawned his silver plate to pay the\\npassage, and went to Frankfort to attend the coronation of the Emperor.\\nHe gave a concert there, and played two of his own concertos. He went\\nto Mayence, where he is said to have had a love-scrape, then to Munich,\\nwhere at the request of the Elector he played before the King of Naples.\\nSoon after his return to Vienna he said good-bye for ever to his dear\\nfriend Haydn, who went with Salomon to England. He was sore distressed.\\nThe position of second Kapellmeister was refused him, and the position of\\nassistant to Hoffmann, the cathedral Kapellmeister, which was granted by\\nthe magistrates at his request, \"without pay for the present,\" depended\\nupon the death of Hoffmann, who outlived him. In the midst of his troubles\\nhe fell in with strange company, and among his associates was Emanuel\\nJohann Schikaneder, a wandering theatre director, poet, composer, and\\nplay-actor. Restless, a bore, vain, improvident, and yet shrewd, he was\\nnot without good qualities that had before this won him the friendship\\nof Mozart. In 1791 he was sorely embarrassed. He was the director of\\nthe Auf der Wieden, a little theatre, no better than a booth, where\\ncomic operas were played and sung. On the verge of failure, he had one\\nthing to console him,--a fairy drama which he had made out of \"Lulu,\\nor the Enchanted Flute,\" a story by Wieland. He asked Mozart to write\\nthe music for it; and Mozart, pleased with the _scenario_, accepted, and\\nsaid, \"If I do not bring you out of your trouble, and if the work is not\\nsuccessful, you must not blame me; for I have never written magic music.\"\\nSchikaneder knew the ease with which Mozart wrote; and he also knew that\\nit was necessary to keep watch over him, that he might be ready at the\\nappointed time. As Mozart\\'s wife was then in Baden, the director found\\nthe composer alone, and he put him in a little pavilion, which was in the\\nmidst of a garden near his theatre. And in this pavilion and in a room\\nof the casino of Josephdorf the music of \"The Magic Flute\" was written.\\nMozart was in a melancholy mood when he began his task, but Schikaneder\\ndrove away his doleful dumps by surrounding him with the gay members of\\nthe company. There was merry eating, there was clinking of glasses, there\\nwas the laughter of women. Here is the origin of many of the exaggerated\\nstories concerning Mozart\\'s dissipated habits. It was long believed that\\nhe was then inspired by the melting eyes of the actress Gerl; a story\\nthat probably rests on no better foundation than the Mrs. Hofdaemmel\\ntragedy, which even Jahn thought worthy of his attention. \"The Magic\\nFlute\" was given Sep. 30, at the Auf der Wieden theatre. The composer\\nled the first two performances. The opera at first disappointed the\\nexpectations of the hearers, and Mozart was cut to the quick. The opera\\nsoon became the fashion, thanks to Schikaneder\\'s obstinacy, so that the\\ntwo hundredth representation was celebrated in Vienna in October, 1795. It\\nwas translated into Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Polish, Italian. It was given\\nin Paris in 1801, under the name of \"The Mysteries of Isis\"; it was first\\nheard in London in 1811, in Italian.\\n\\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE SEVERAL HOUSES IN VIENNA IN WHICH MOZART LIVED.]\\n\\nOne evening in July a strange man called on Mozart with a strange errand.\\nHe was tall, gaunt, haggard in face, solemn in demeanor: a fantastic\\napparition, dressed completely in grey, or, as some affirm in black; such\\na character as might have appeared to Hoffmann when in the black and dark\\nnight, surrounded by spirits of his own conjuring, he wrote wild tales.\\nThe visitor gravely handed him an anonymous letter sealed in black, which\\nbegged him to write a Requiem as soon as possible, and asked the price.\\nMozart named 50 ducats, some say 100; the visitor paid the sum, and as\\nMozart did not name the time for the completion of the work, the unknown\\nman left him, saying, \"I shall return, when it is time.\" The mystery\\nhas been solved. The stranger was Leutgeb, the steward of Count Franz\\nvon Walsegg of Stuppach; the Count was in the habit of ordering thus\\nmysteriously compositions from different musicians; he would copy them\\nand have them performed as his own; the requiem was ordered in memory of\\nhis late wife; and it was sung as Walsegg\\'s work under his direction Dec.\\n14, 1793. But Mozart knew nothing of the patron or the steward, and he\\ngrew superstitious. In the middle of August he received a commission to\\nwrite a festival opera for the celebration of the coronation of Leopold\\nII. as King of Bohemia in Prague. The subject was Metastasio\\'s \"Clemenza\\ndi Tito.\" The music was written hurriedly and first performed Sept. 6. It\\nwas not successful; the Empress is said to have spoken bitterly concerning\\nthe _porcheria_ of German music. Just as he was stepping into the carriage\\nfor his journey to Prague, the thin and haggard man suddenly appeared\\nand asked him what would become of the Requiem. Mozart made his excuses.\\n\"When will you be ready?\" said Leutgeb. \"I swear that I shall work on it\\nunceasingly when I return.\" \"Good,\" said the solemn stranger, \"I rely\\non your promise.\" And as soon as the \"Magic Flute\" was completed and\\nperformed Mozart worked eagerly on the Requiem. He postponed his lessons,\\ngiving as an excuse that he had a work on hand which lay very near his\\nheart, and until it was finished he could think of nothing else. He had\\nbecome subject to fainting fits, and in Prague he was not at all well. He\\nbecame gloomy and superstitious. He thought some one had poisoned him, and\\nindeed, for a long time it was believed foolishly by some that Salieri had\\nhastened his death. He told Constanze that he was writing the Requiem for\\nhimself. There was a slight improvement for a time, and Mozart worked on\\nthe Requiem, which had been taken away from him, and finished a Masonic\\ncantata. The last of November his feet and hands began to swell; he\\nvomited violently; and he was melancholy in mind. The 28th his condition\\nwas critical and his doctor consulted with the chief physician at the\\nhospital. The \"Magic Flute\" was now successful; he was certain of an\\nannual income of one thousand florins contributed by some of the Hungarian\\nnobility; and of a larger sum each year from Amsterdam in return for the\\nproduction of a few compositions exclusively for the subscribers; but it\\nwas too late. The day before his death he said to Constanze, \"I should\\nlike to have heard my \\'Magic Flute\\' once more,\" and he hummed feebly the\\nbird-catcher\\'s song. In the afternoon he had the Requiem brought to his\\nbed, and he sang the alto part. At the first measures of the \"Lacrimosa,\"\\nhe wept violently and laid the score aside. Mrs. Haible came in the\\nevening and Mozart said, \"I am glad you are here; stay with me to-night,\\nand see me die.\" She tried to reason with him, and he answered. \"I have\\nthe flavor of death on my tongue: I taste death. Who will support my\\ndearest Constanze if you do not stay with her?\" The story of his ending\\nas told by Otto Jahn is most pathetic. Mrs. Haible went to the priests of\\nSt. Peter\\'s and begged that one might be sent to Mozart, as if by chance.\\nThey refused for a long time, and it was with difficulty she persuaded\\n\"these clerical barbarians\" to grant her request. When she returned,\\nshe found Sussmayer at Mozart\\'s bedside, in earnest conversation over\\nthe Requiem. \"Did I not say that I was writing the Requiem for myself?\"\\nsaid he looking at it through his tears. \"And he was so convinced of his\\napproaching death that he enjoined his wife to inform Albrechtsberger\\nof it before it became generally known, in order that he might secure\\nMozart\\'s place at the Stephanskirche, which belonged to him by every\\nright.\" The physician finally came; he was found in the theatre, where he\\nwaited until the curtain fell. He saw there was no hope; cold bandages\\nwere applied to the head; and then came delirium and unconsciousness.\\nMozart was busy with his Requiem. He blew out his cheeks to imitate the\\ntrumpets and the drums. About midnight he raised himself, opened his eyes\\nwide, then seemed to fall asleep. He died at one o\\'clock, Dec. 5th. There\\nwas but little money in the house. The funeral expenses (third-class)\\namounted to 8 fl., 36 kr., and there was an extra charge of three florins\\nfor the hearse. In the afternoon of the 6th the body was blessed. There\\nwas a fierce storm raging, and no one accompanied the body to the grave.\\nThe body was put into a common vault, which was dug up about every ten\\nyears. No stone was put above his resting-place, and no man knows his\\ngrave. Constanze was left with two children and about sixty florins ready\\nmoney. The outstanding accounts and personal property hardly amounted to\\nfive hundred florins. There were debts to be paid. She gave a concert, and\\nwith the assistance of the Emperor the proceeds were sufficient to pay\\nthem. In 1809 she married George Nissen and was comfortable until 1842,\\nthe year of her death. Karl, the elder son of Mozart, pianist-merchant,\\ndied in Milan in a subordinate official position. Wolfgang, born July 26,\\n1791, appeared in public in 1805; he afterward was a musical director and\\ncomposer in Lemberg and Vienna; he died in Carlsbad in 1844. A statue was\\nerected to Mozart in Salzburg in 1842, and one was raised in Vienna in\\n1859. The hundredth anniversary of his birth was celebrated throughout\\nGermany, and that of his death throughout the world.\\n\\n[Illustration: HOUSE IN VIENNA WHERE MOZART DIED.\\n\\nFormerly at No. 934 Raubensteingasse. Building destroyed.]\\n\\nThe face of Mozart has been idealized. The authentic portraits coincide\\nwith the descriptions of his contemporaries. He was small, thin, and pale;\\nwith a large head and a large nose; eyes well shaped, but short-sighted,\\nalthough he never wore spectacles; he had plenty of fine hair, of which\\nhe was proud, and he was vain of his hands and feet; he dressed carefully\\nand elegantly, and was fond of jewelry. He rode horseback, and took\\ngreat pleasure in playing billiards, bowls, and in dancing. He was very\\nfond of punch, of which beverage Kelly saw him take \"copious draughts.\"\\nHis prevailing characteristics were amiability, generosity, and a warm\\nappreciation of all that was good and noble in music or mankind. His\\ngenerosity was strikingly shown when, in the darkest hours of need, he\\noffered to take care of Mariana until her betrothed had found the position\\nnecessary for marriage. It was no doubt often abused by such scapegraces\\nas Stadler and Schikaneder. He poured out his affection on the members of\\nhis household. He associated freely, and apparently with equal enjoyment,\\nwith aristocrats, learned men, members of the orchestra, singers, and\\nloungers in the taverns. He was full of fun, and he dearly loved a joke;\\nhe delighted in doggerel rhymes. His intercourse with musicians was as a\\nrule friendly, and he seldom spoke ill of his neighbors. Gluck appreciated\\nhim as much as Salieri envied him, but he and Mozart were never intimate,\\nalthough they dined together and paid each other compliments. Kozeluch\\nand other small fry hated him, and they also hated Haydn. His relations\\nwith Paisiello, Sarti and Martin were most friendly; and nothing perhaps\\nillustrates more clearly the sweetness of Mozart\\'s nature than his\\nimmortalizing a theme from Martin\\'s \"Cosa rara,\" an opera which had\\nprevailed against his \"Figaro,\" by introducing it in the second finale of\\n\"Don Giovanni.\" He praised Pleyel, sympathized with Gyrowetz, foresaw the\\ngreatness of Beethoven, mourned the death of Linley, and loved Haydn.\\n\\nIn his youth he showed a fondness for arithmetic, and in later years he\\nwas a ready reckoner. He had an unmistakable talent for the languages;\\nhe understood the French, English, and Italian tongues. He was acquainted\\nwith Latin; he had read the works of excellent authors; he even wrote\\npoetry, but as a manner of jesting. He was not without knowledge of\\nhistory. He drew with skill. His letters are full of charm, and Nissen\\nregretted that a man who used his pen so cleverly had not written\\nconcerning his art. The reply to this is simple, namely, that Mozart was\\ntoo busy in making music to write about it. This most honest and amiable\\nof men loved animals, and birds were particularly dear to him.\\n\\nWhatever his religious convictions may have been after he reached man\\'s\\nestate, he wrote to his father, on hearing of his illness, as follows: \"As\\ndeath, strictly speaking, is the true end and aim of our lives, I have\\nfor the last two years made myself so well acquainted with this true,\\nbest friend of mankind, that his image no longer terrifies, but calms and\\nconsoles me. And I thank God for giving me the opportunity of learning to\\nlook upon death as the key that unlocks the gate of true bliss.\" The man\\nas seen in his life and letters was simple, true, averse to flattery and\\nsycophancy, generous, and eminently lovable.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of a letter from Mozart to his publisher,\\nHofmeister]\\n\\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO MOZART IN VIENNA CEMETERY]\\n\\n[Illustration: Chorus by Mr. Wolfgang Mozart 1765.\\n\\nLeopold Mozart brought his children Wolfgang (aged 8) and Maria Anna (aged\\n13), in April, 1764, to London, on a concert tour. The exhibition of these\\nwonder-children lasted till July, 1765. Before leaving, the party visited\\nthe British Museum, which was opened to the public six years before (on\\nthe 15th January, 1759). On this occasion Wolfgang was requested to leave\\nthe Institution some manuscripts of his compositions. Mozart complied, and\\namong the manuscripts left was this, his first effort in Choral-writing,\\nand the only one composed on an English text. The father received the\\nfollowing acknowledgment:--\\n\\n    SIR:--I am ordered by the Standing Committee of the Trustees of\\n    the British Museum, to signify to You, that they have received the\\n    present of the Musical performances of Your very ingenious Son,\\n    which You were pleased lately to make Them, and to return You their\\n    Thanks for the same.\\n\\n    M. MALY,\\n    _Secretary_.\\n    British Museum,\\n    July 19, 1765.\\n]\\n\\n[Illustration: LAST PORTRAIT OF MOZART.\\n\\nPainted by his brother-in-law Lange in 1791. The head is finished, but not\\nthe coat.]\\n\\nIn considering the compositions of this man, who died before he was\\nthirty-six, and spent much time in travel, the most superficial\\ninvestigator must be struck by the mere number. There are 20 dramatic\\nworks; 2 oratorios, a funeral hymn, 3 cantatas, and the reinstrumentation\\nof 4 oratorios by Handel; 66 vocal pieces with orchestral accompaniments;\\n23 canons and a collection of songs; 48 pieces for the church, and 20\\nmasses, including the Requiem, which however was probably completed by\\nSussmayer; 22 pianoforte sonatas and fantasias; 17 organ sonatas, 16\\nvariations for bugle and pianoforte, 23 little pieces, and 11 sonatas\\nand pieces for four hands on two pianofortes; 45 sonatas for violin\\nand pianoforte; 8 trios, 2 quartets and 1 quintette for pianoforte and\\nstrings; for strings alone there are 3 duos, 3 trios, 29 quartets, 8\\nquintets; then there are 2 quartets with flute, 1 with oboe, 1 quintet\\nwith horn; 10 concertos for violin, 1 for two violins, 1 for violin\\nand viola, 28 for the pianoforte, 1 for two pianofortes, 1 for three\\npianofortes, 1 for bassoon, 1 for oboe, 4 for flute and 1 for flute and\\nharp, 5 for horn, 1 for clarinet,--in all 55; in dance music there is\\none gavotte, 39 contradances, 56 waltzes, 96 minuets, a pantomime and a\\nballet; there are 27 different pieces of instrumental music, as marches,\\nadagios, etc., 33 divertissements, serenades or cassations, all pieces\\nof long breath, including each from 10 to 12 movements; there are 49\\nsymphonies. These authentic works, accepted by Kochel, number in all 769\\ncompositions. Then when one reflects on the quality of the music and its\\nartistic value, when one finds in nearly each work the traces at least\\nof genius, and reflects that a third of them are masterpieces, he begins\\nto realize the might of the man. He was naturally the most spontaneous\\nof musicians, and in this respect--in pure creation--without doubt the\\ngreatest of them all. Rarely are seen such fecundity and such versatility.\\nUnlike Handel, when a work was finished, it was finished; it did not enter\\nagain into another composition. The charge of plagiarism was never brought\\nagainst him except in one instance: the religious march in \"Idomeneus\" was\\ntraced by a friend to the march in Gluck\\'s \"Alceste.\" He wrote as though\\nhe could not help it. Jumping from the bed, he ran to the pianoforte. The\\nbarber found him restless. His mind was preoccupied at table. In travel,\\nthe landscape, the very motion of the carriage stimulated his imagination.\\nHe was constantly jotting down his thoughts on scraps of paper. Much of\\nhis greatest music was composed, even in detail, in his head before he\\ntook his pen. The conversation of his friends, noises in the house or\\nstreet did not distract him. His faculty of concentration was incredibly\\ndeveloped, and Constanze said that he wrote his scores as though he\\nwere writing a letter. And so his inspiration, as shown in the hasty\\ncomposition of the \"Don Giovanni\" overture, reminded Victor Wilder of\\nthe saying of the first Napoleon: \"Inspiration is only the instantaneous\\nsolution of a long meditated problem.\"\\n\\nIn examining the works themselves, many of them must be passed over\\nwithout notice. Some were written for special occasions; some, for\\ncombinations of instruments, that no longer, or rarely, are heard in\\nconcert-halls; and it would be idle to assert that all his works are\\nequally worthy of respect. The complete collection of the writings of even\\nsuch a genius as Voltaire contains dreary pages and frivolous opinions.\\nLet us examine more particularly his pianoforte music, the chamber music,\\nsuch as the string quartets and quintets; the symphonies; the religious\\nmusic; and the operas, looking at the works themselves, comparing them\\nwith that which was contemporaneous, and observing the influence on\\nthe musicians that followed him. The songs, with the exception of the\\n\"Veilchen\" (The Violet), were set to meaningless words and are not to\\nbe ranked with the best of his compositions; but this same \"Violet\" in\\nits lyrical-dramatic setting pointed the way to the after glory of the\\nGerman song as seen in Schubert, Schumann and Franz. And nearly all of the\\nconcert-arias written for special singers and for special use seem to-day\\na little antiquated, and cast in the old and traditional mould. As Mozart\\nfirst was known as a pianoforte player, let us first look at his writings\\nfor that instrument. (I use the term pianoforte throughout this article,\\nfollowing the example of Rubinstein, who, in his \"Conversation on Music\"\\n(1892), speaks of compositions for Clavecin, Clavichord, Clavi-cymbal,\\nVirginal, Spinett, etc., \"as written for pianoforte, as to-day we can only\\nperform them on this instrument.\")\\n\\nThere is no doubt but that Mozart was the greatest pianoforte player of\\nhis time. The testimony in his favor is overwhelming. His hands were\\nsmall and well-shaped, and some of his hearers wondered that he could do\\nso much with them. He had elaborated an admirable system of fingering,\\nwhich he owed to the careful study of Bach, whose pianoforte music he\\nhad played from a very early age. He regarded good fingering as the\\nbasis of expressive playing. He insisted that the player should have\\n\"a quiet, steady hand,\" and that the passages should \"flow like oil\";\\nhe therefore objected to all bravura feats that might be detrimental\\nto \"the natural ease and flexibility.\" He was vexed by exaggerations\\nof tempos, by over-rapidity of execution, by sentimental rubatos. He\\ndemanded correctness, \"ease and certainty, delicacy and good taste, and\\nabove all the power of breathing life and emotion into the music and of\\nso expressing its meaning as to place the performer for the moment on a\\nlevel with the creator of the work before him.\" It is hard for men of\\nanother generation to gain an idea of the qualities of the virtuosoship\\nof the pianist that moved and thrilled the audiences of his time. We\\nmust take the word of his hearers. Clementi declared that he never heard\\nany one play so intellectually and gracefully as Mozart. Rochlitz waxed\\nenthusiastic over the brilliancy and \"the heart-melting tenderness of\\nhis execution;\" Dittersdorf praised the union of art and taste; and\\nHaydn, with tears in his eyes, could not forget his playing, because it\\ncame from the heart. Unfortunately we can not estimate his virtues as a\\nplayer from his works, for all that heard him agree that his improvising\\nwas the crowning glory of his art. Variations on a well-known theme were\\nin fashion, and the variations were often improvised. The published\\nvariations of Mozart are light and pleasing; he did not care for them, and\\nthey were written, no doubt, for the entertainment of his pupils or his\\nfriends. Of the three rondos, the one in A minor (1787) is very original\\nand of exquisite beauty, and is a favorite to-day in concert-halls.\\nThe fantasia in C minor (1785) is an important work. Five movements,\\nin various keys and tempos are bound together, and though each is in a\\nmeasure independent, the sections seem to follow each other inevitably.\\nThe harmonies are daring, when the date of its composition is considered,\\nand the mood, the _Stimmung_, is modern in its melancholy and doubt. In\\ntreating the sonata form Mozart was the successor of Ph. Em. Bach and\\nHaydn.\\n\\nWhether his sonatas of the Vienna period are solo or accompanied by other\\ninstruments, they have only three movements. He first sought beauty of\\nmelody, for song was to him the foundation, the highest expression of\\nmusic. Therefore the themes were carefully sung, and the second subject\\nwas made of more importance by him than by his predecessors. Often the\\nchief effect in his sonata movements as in his concertos is gained by\\nthe delivery of a sustained melody, and these melodies written for his\\nown hands show the influence of the peculiar characteristics of his own\\nperformance. Frequently in the elaboration of the themes he introduced\\nnew melodies, so that we find Dittersdorf complaining of the prodigality\\nof the composer, who \"gives his hearers no time to breathe.\" When he used\\npolyphony, it was not to display pedantry but to accentuate the beauty of\\nthe themes.\\n\\nThe slow middle movements are in song form, and are full of emotion and\\ntender grace; eminently spontaneous, and coming from the heart. The final\\nmovements are generally the weakest. They show the facility with which he\\nwrote, and their gayness often approaches triviality. Passing over the\\npianoforte compositions for two performers and for two pianofortes--not\\nthat they are unworthy of attention-- we come to the sonatas with violin\\naccompaniment, which, during the Vienna period, were, many of them,\\nwritten for pupils. They are characterized by beautiful melodies and bold\\nharmonies rather than by any great depth or exhibition of scholarship. The\\nviolin part is independent, and not an accompaniment, as was usual at the\\ntime. The trios or terzets for pianoforte, violin and \\'cello were chiefly\\nwritten for amateurs to play in musical parties. Violoncellists of any\\nforce were rare in these circles, and it is not unlikely that this was a\\nserious hindrance to Mozart\\'s further development of the trio. Far greater\\nin breadth of design and in thematic elaboration are the two pianoforte\\nquartets (1785 and 1786). The trios were written for social purposes,\\nand brilliancy was perhaps too much cultivated; but in these quartets\\npassion enters, strong and fierce and bitter. In 1784 Mozart wrote his\\nfather that his quintet in E-flat major for pianoforte, oboe, clarinet,\\nhorn, and bassoon, which was received with great applause in a concert\\ngiven by him in the theatre, was the best thing he had ever written, and\\nhe chose it to play before Paesiello. It is certainly a composition of\\nremarkable beauty, not so much on account of its thematic invention as for\\nits intimate knowledge of the peculiarities of the different instruments\\nand for the balance of euphony preserved throughout. The pianoforte\\nconcertos, of which seventeen were written in Vienna, were, as a rule,\\nintended for his own concert use. He described the first three as \"a\\nhappy medium between too easy and too difficult.\" He added in this letter\\nto his father, that \"even ignoramuses will be pleased with them without\\nknowing why.\" Two years later (1784) he wrote, \"I cannot make a choice\\nbetween the two concertos in B-flat and D. Either one will make the player\\nsweat.\" The distinguishing merit of these compositions for pianoforte and\\norchestra, unjustly neglected in these days, is the combination of the\\ntwo different forces, while these forces at the same time preserve their\\nindividuality. Instead of a duel to the death between the instrument and\\nthe orchestra, there is a generous appreciation of the qualities and\\nlimitations of the pianoforte, which in Mozart\\'s time was still weak\\nin mechanism. Therefore one gives way to the other for the effect of\\nthe whole. The orchestra enters not to crush but to support. Often the\\npianoforte part seems absurdly simple, but a closer investigation will\\nshow that this simplicity is most artfully designed and intended. Seldom\\nare important themes given to the pianoforte or orchestra alone; they are\\nshared generously. And no words can reproduce the colors of the orchestral\\ntone-paintings, or describe the marvelous results gained by simple means\\nand an unerring instinct. The first movements are in the sonata form, but\\nthere is a certain freedom, and the proportions are on a larger scale.\\nThere is a cadenza, invariable, at the conclusion, and Mozart in his\\nconcerts excited wonder by his improvisations. The cadenzas published\\nwere for the use of pupils. The second movement is in song-form, full of\\nsentiment, often romantic, the expression of temperament; the song is\\nsometimes varied. The last movement is generally in rondo form, and the\\ninfluence of the dance is strongly marked. These movements are gay and\\ngraceful, and occasionally there is a touch of Haydn\\'s humor. The greatest\\nof these concertos are perhaps those in D minor (K. 466), C (467), C minor\\n(491) and in C (503). Nor among his pianoforte works must the two pieces\\noriginally written for a musical clock be forgotten, which are only now\\nknown by a four-hand arrangement. The pianoforte works of Mozart are much\\nneglected in these days, and most unjustly. It is the fashion to call them\\nsimple and antiquated. But the best of the concertos and the sonatas make\\nsevere demands upon the mechanism and taste of the pianist; the apparent\\nsimplicity is often a stumbling block to him that eyes them askew; and\\nonly by an absolute mastery of the mechanism controlled by temperament can\\nthe song be sung as Mozart heard it, so that the hearer may forget the box\\nof cold keys and jingling wires.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n    Mozart\\'s ear.\\n\\n    Common ear.\\n\\nMOZART\\'S EAR COMPARED WITH AVERAGE EAR.\\n\\nFirst published in Nissen\\'s Biography of Mozart.]\\n\\nIn the days of Mozart the favorite amusement of wealthy amateurs of\\nmusic was the string quartet. Haydn was the man who first showed the\\nway, although Boccherini should not be utterly forgotten. The set of\\nsix dedicated by Mozart to Haydn, show the growth of the quartet, the\\nindividualizing of each part. For in the ideal work of this species, each\\npart should be of equal importance. This advance, however, was not to the\\npublic taste. He was accused of undue originality. Prince Grassalcovicz\\nwas so angry when he found that the discords coming from the players were\\nactually in the parts, that he tore the pages in pieces. The publisher\\nreturned them, as full of printer\\'s errors. Learned men, as Fetis and G.\\nWeber, have written learned analyses of the introduction to the quartet in\\nC major, against it and in its favor. The hearers of to-day, accustomed\\nto the last quartets of Beethoven and the licenses of modern composers,\\nare not shocked even by the celebrated false relations in the aforesaid\\nintroduction. Not only do these compositions display, in clearest light,\\nthe mastery of form and all contrapuntal devices; they are a mine of\\nsensuous and spiritual riches. The quartet is ennobled; the minuet, that\\njolly, rustic dance of Haydn, becomes, with Mozart, the court dance of\\nnoble dames, full of grace and delicacy. The finales abound in dignified\\nhumor, and occasionally pathos is found. Upon these six quartets Mozart\\nlavished the treasures of his nature and his art. In writing the three for\\nFrederick William II. of Prussia, he remembered the favorite instrument of\\nthe monarch, and brought the violoncello into greater prominence, making\\nit often a solo instrument, with the melody in its higher notes. This\\nnecessitated a different treatment of the violins and viola, and resulted\\nin more brilliancy with an occasional loss of strength. Written, as they\\nwere, to gratify the taste of a monarch, they show more elegance, perhaps,\\nthan depth of feeling, but in invention and in exquisite proportion they\\nare worthy of even the great name of Mozart. Without stopping to examine\\nas carefully as it deserves the remarkable trio for violin, viola, and\\nvioloncello (K. 563), in six movements, let us glance at the quintets, in\\nwhich the viola is doubled, unlike the many compositions of Boccherini in\\nwhich two \\'cellos are employed. The quintets in C major and G minor were\\ncomposed in 1787, the D major in 1790, the E-flat major, 1791. These four\\nquintets follow the path pointed out by the six quartets. There are biting\\nand harsh passages, to impress more forcibly the composer\\'s intentions,\\n\"comparatively frequent successions of ninths in a circle of fifths.\" And\\neven Mozart seldom wrote anything so full of wild and sobbing passion as\\nthe first movement of the G-minor quintet, in which the second subject is\\nof an Italian intensity and a conviction that remind one of the terrible\\nearnestness of Verdi, the Verdi of the middle period. Yet this melody,\\nso direct and complete, is taken as matter for contrapuntal treatment.\\nThe adagio is also a masterpiece, approached, perhaps equalled, but not\\nsurpassed by Beethoven. Polyphony is the life of these quintets; but it\\nis not purely scholastic polyphony. Mozart once said to Michael Kelly,\\n\"Melody is the essence of music. I compare a good melodist to a fine\\nracer, and counterpointists to hack post horses.\" But in these quintets\\nthe counterpoint is so melodious that the tricks and strainings of the\\npedagogue are never brought to mind. Here may also be mentioned the\\nquintet in A major for clarinet and strings (1789), written for Anton\\nStadler, a dissipated fellow, a toss-pot, and riggish. But Mozart loved\\nhim because he blew cunningly the clarinet, and he went about with him,\\nand ate with him, and drank with him. Although it is freer in form than\\nthe great quartets, and the quintets in G minor, this clarinet quintet\\nstands beside them in its grace tinged with melancholy, its contrapuntal\\nskill masterly disguised, its divine melody.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOZART IN PROFILE.\\n\\nCut in boxwood by Posch, a Salzburg sculptor, in 1789. This important\\noriginal has served as a model for many posthumous portraits of Mozart.]\\n\\nA review of the symphonies of Mozart is a summing up of the history of\\nthe symphony in the eighteenth century from childhood to maturity. He\\nwas eight years old when he wrote in London his first symphony. It is\\nin sonata form: allegro, andante, finale: he uses the orchestra of the\\npredecessors of Haydn, viz., two violins, viola, bass, two oboes, and\\ntwo horns. These early symphonies of Mozart are relics of the time when\\nGerman instrumental music was still in a comparatively crude condition,\\nand they are chiefly interesting from the historical point of view; for\\neven Kochel, the devoted admirer of Mozart, says that they are wanting in\\ncharacter and that the motives are without development. Look for instance\\nat the first symphony. The allegro has one hundred and eighteen measures;\\nthe andante fifty; the presto ninety-one. According to the fashion of the\\nold suite the three movements are in the same tonality. The symphonies of\\n1764 and 1765 are in the same form; in two of them the andante is in a\\ndifferent key from the other movements. It was in 1767 that Mozart first\\nintroduced the minuet, which was, however, without a trio. The seventeen\\nsymphonies written from 1767 to 1772 show an advance in instrumentation\\nrather than in growth of form. The early ones were composed for the\\neight-part orchestra, the foundation of modern orchestral works. In the\\nsecond, the two horns are replaced by two clarinets, and a bassoon is\\nadded. Now the use of the clarinet was then rare. Christopher Denner made\\nthe first clarinet in 1701. Gossec wrote for the instrument in 1756, and\\nit was first heard in England in Christian Bach\\'s opera \"Orione\" (1763).\\nMozart used it also in a symphony written in Paris in 1778, and he did\\nnot introduce it again until 1783. One of the greatest innovations of\\nthis master, the father of orchestral color, was the knowledge of the\\nresources of this instrument, whose voice, as Berlioz well says, is the\\nvoice of heroic love. In Mozart\\'s works, \"whether it sings with full and\\nsonorous voice some episodic phrase or displays all the riches of its two\\n_timbres_ in a superb adagio, everywhere it is brought fully into light,\\neverywhere it plays an important role.\" In 1768, Mozart used the drums\\nand one trumpet; in 1769 two bassoons; in 1770 two trumpets; in 1771, in\\nan andante, two flutes. He was still making experiments. In 1773, for\\nthe first time, he composed a symphony in the minor mode; and in this\\nyear he first went over 200 measures in the opening allegro; he also used\\nfour horns. In 1774 he employed two viola parts. In 1778 the \"Parisian\"\\nsymphony was performed with great success at a _Concert Spirituel_. Never\\nbefore had he developed his motives to so great a length; never before\\nhad he employed so large an orchestra; the score includes, besides the\\nstring parts, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two\\nhorns, two trumpets, drums,--in all seventeen parts. Haydn did not use so\\nlarge an orchestra until 1793. The allegros are brilliant and animated,\\nfollowing the French taste of the time, and they were loudly applauded;\\nthe andante did not produce so great an effect. After his return to\\nGermany he was obliged to reduce his orchestral forces, and to cut his\\ncloth to suit his opportunities. The \"Haffner\" made over from a serenade\\nshows that the forms of the ancient serenade and modern symphony were\\nstill confounded; its allegro is not symphonic, but one theme is present\\nand rules from beginning to end. In 1783, in the symphony in C, he first\\nwrote an introduction to the first movement. In 1786 the symphony in D,\\nwith an introduction, was brought out at Prague with unbounded success.\\nIt contains, like the \"Parisian,\" no minuet. It opens with a solemn\\nadagio introduction; the allegro bears a rhythmical resemblance in its\\nfirst theme to that of the \"Magic Flute\" overture; the andante is often\\ncited as a perfect example of the exquisite grace of Mozart; the finale\\nin its sparkling vivacity brings to mind a number of \"Figaro.\" And here\\nit may be said that the symphonic instrumentation of Mozart approaches\\ncloser dramatic formulas than that of Haydn or Beethoven. The three last\\nsymphonies of Mozart show a wonderful advance. In a certain expression and\\nin a certain treatment they belong to the nineteenth century. There is\\nmore blood, more intensity, a dread of unmeaning formalism. Technically\\nthey are beyond criticism; and in pure expression of remarkable musical\\nthought, in sense of euphony and proportion, in perfection of musical\\nstyle they stand a marvel for all time. The one in E-flat was written in\\nJune, 1788. To gain the wished-for effects clarinets are used, and no\\noboes. The prevailing rhythm is ternary; and yet Mozart has so varied\\nthe pace of the movements that there is no feeling of monotony on this\\naccount. No prismatic words can give an idea of this \"triumph of euphony\";\\nalthough German commentators have exhausted what has been inelegantly\\ndescribed as \"the drivel of panegyric.\" It is true that there are points\\nof resemblance to Haydn\\'s style; \"but Mozart\\'s individuality is here so\\noverpowering as to have given its distinguishing stamp to these very\\nfeatures.\" No wonder that German romanticists have sought refuge in\\nextravagance in description. Apel attempted to turn the symphony into\\na poem which was to imitate in words the character of the different\\nmovements. Hoffmann, writer of tales of horror, composer and conductor,\\ncaricaturist, critic, and official, one of the first to realize the\\ngreatness of Beethoven, called the symphony the \"Swan Song.\" \"Love and\\nmelancholy breathe forth in purest spirit tones; we feel ourselves drawn\\nwith inexpressible longing towards the forms which beckon us to join them\\nin their flight through the clouds to another sphere. The night blots\\nout the last purple rays of day, and we extend our arms to the beings\\nthat summon us as they move with the spheres in the eternal circles of\\nthe solemn dance.\" Our criticism of to-day is written in a different\\nspirit. We use freely the test-tube and litmus paper; we pry and analyse.\\nSuch out-pourings we call hifalutin; but it must be remembered that\\nthe acute Hoffmann put them into the mouth of the half-crazed Johannes\\nKreisler. A striking contrast to the E-flat symphony is the G minor\\nwritten in July, 1788. Deldevez has described it in a sentence; \"It is\\ngraceful, passionate, melancholy; it is inspiration united with science.\"\\nDeldevez has also pointed out that it is the truest and the most complete\\nexpression of the minor mode; that the tonality is treated in the most\\nvigorous manner; that the modulations succeed each other according to the\\nsevere precepts of the school. It is the symphony of Mozart that is most\\nfull of passion, and yet the composer never forgot in writing it that\\n\"music, when expressing horrors, must still be music.\" The symphony in\\nC, August, 1788, is called, for some reason or other, possibly for its\\nmajesty, the \"Jupiter.\" There is here not so much of human sentiment and\\npassion as in the G minor symphony, but there is the splendor, as well as\\nthe serenity that is peculiar to Mozart; and the finale is a masterpiece\\nof contrapuntal skill that is unsurpassed in music, for the fugue is made\\non a symphonic plan, and thus two distinct art-forms are moulded into\\none. Jahn has said that the highest quality of these three symphonies\\nis \"the harmony of tone-color, the healthy combination of orchestral\\nsound,\" and he admits at the same time the impotence of language to\\nreproduce the substance of a musical work. Richard Wagner wrote that \"the\\nlonging sigh of the great human voice, drawn to him by the loving power\\nof his genius, breathes from his instruments.\" And in these sayings the\\ntwo great elements of Mozart\\'s symphonic writing are fitly described.\\nIn his pianoforte concertos Mozart strove to set out and adorn by the\\norchestral instruments the pianoforte part, and at the same time give an\\nenchanting musical background. In his symphonies \"he sought to give his\\nmelody, by way of compensation for its delivery by mere instruments, the\\ndepth of feeling and ardor that lies at the source of the human voice as\\nthe expression of the unfathomable depths of the heart\"; and in this he\\nsucceeded by leading \"the irresistible stream of richest harmony into the\\nheart of his melody.\" Well might the cool-headed Ambros say of the last\\ngreat three, \"considered as pure music, it is hardly worth while to ask\\nwhether the world possesses anything more perfect.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO MOZART IN SALZBURG.\\n\\nErected in 1842.]\\n\\nMozart, as we have seen, wrote much for the church. Unfortunately the\\nbest known of his masses were written to suit the florid taste of his\\npatron; and his church music, judged thereby, has been reproached for its\\nfrivolity and insincerity. Some, forgetting the solemnity of the litanies\\nde venerabili, the dignity of the vespers, the heavenly \"Ave Verum,\" the\\n\"Qui tollis\" from the mass in C minor, and portions of the Requiem, have\\ndenied him religious feeling, so far as his religious music is concerned.\\nBut the musical expression of religious feeling differs with the time,\\nthe place, and the individual. What is religious music? To the Aztec, who\\nin religious sacrifice cut out the victim\\'s heart, the beating of the\\nserpent-skin drum was religious music; to the monks of the Middle Ages the\\ndrone of the plain song of the church seemed the expression of religious\\ncontemplation; and to-day many worthy people find spiritual consolation\\nin the joyous ditties of the Salvation Army. We define religious music\\nconformably with our own religious sentiment. In the days of Palestrina,\\nchurch music influenced subtly the congregation; it created a mood,\\na _Stimmung_. In the days of Haydn and Mozart the influence of the\\nvirtuosoship of the opera-singer was strongly felt; it invaded the church;\\nit was recognized by the composer of the mass. So in more modern days\\nthe dramatic instinct of operatic composers is seen in their religious\\nworks; and one may say with Rubinstein, \"I think it an error, however, to\\ncondemn for that reason the \\'Stabat Mater\\' of Rossini or the \\'Requiem\\'\\nof Verdi in Protestant countries. The Protestant may indeed say: \\'I have\\na different feeling,\\' but not, \\'That is bad, because it is other than my\\nfeeling of worship.\\'\" Thibaut may attack the church music of Mozart, and\\nLorenz may defend it; each expresses thereby his own religious sentiment.\\nIt is true that many of the masses of Mozart, considered as music, are\\nnot to be compared with his works of a higher flight; and the one that is\\nthe most popular, the 12th, so called, was not written by him. But how\\nabout the \"Requiem,\" which he left unfinished, and which has been the\\nsubject of so many legends, so many disputes? Did not the mystery that\\nfor a time surrounded its birth give it a fictitious value? The Requiem\\nand Kyrie are the work of Mozart as they now exist; the movements from\\nthe Dies Iræ to the first eight bars of the Lacrimosa, also the Domine\\nJesu and Hostias, were finished by him in the voice part and bass, and\\nthe principal points of the instrumentation were also indicated by him.\\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the part of Sussmayer, who completed it,\\nis considerable. Now there has been much discussion concerning the merits\\nof the double fugue even from the technical standpoint, and it is true\\nthat the most beautiful portions of the work are the least polyphonic,\\nas the wailing Lacrimosa, which beyond a peradventure belongs to Mozart,\\nalthough so little was actually written with his own hand; the Confutatis\\nwith the antiphonal effects of male and female voices, and the marvellous,\\nunearthly harmonies of the _Oro supplex_; the powerful and concise\\n_Rex tremendae_. On the other hand the _Tuba mirum_ with the trombone\\ncantabile is an inadequate setting of the dread scene. By many worshippers\\nof Mozart, who at the same time believe in the supremacy of religious\\nmusic, the Requiem is called the truest and most genuine expression of\\nMozart\\'s nature, and his imperishable monument. But the contrary opinion\\nnow prevails among prominent musicians. The Requiem as a whole cannot\\nbe considered as complete a revelation of the genius of the composer as\\nthe G-minor symphony, the quartets dedicated to Haydn, \"Figaro\" or \"Don\\nGiovanni.\"\\n\\nNow the supreme genius of Mozart is seen in his dramatic works. It has\\nbeen said that he completed the palace of Italian opera and laid the\\nenduring foundations of the German. This saying has more of epigram than\\ntruth; or it is only partially true. The opera is a thing of fashion,\\nan amusement of the day. It is finally shaped by the prevailing popular\\ntaste, although the beginnings of a new and varying form may be in\\nopposition to that taste. The history of opera from the time of its\\ninvention at Florence to the pilgrimages to Bayreuth is a story of fickle\\ntastes, passionate caprices, violent disputes. First there was the revolt\\nagainst the contrapuntists; then came the rule of the singer; then the\\nconflict between dramatic truth and personal vainglory, a conflict that\\nwas born with the birth of opera. Run over the \"History of Operas\" by\\nClement and Larousse; glance at the roll of singers from the early times\\nof virtuosoship: names that are utterly forgotten, and yet they once\\nfilled the mouths of men and were the idols of the day. It is a dreary\\nbusiness, this reading of the exploits of singers and opera makers of\\nthe past,--not unlike the deciphering of moss-covered tombstones in\\nthe hillside graveyard of a well-nigh deserted New England village.\\nTo better appreciate the work of Mozart, let us briefly consider the\\ncondition of opera when he first looked toward the stage. In the middle\\nof the eighteenth century the singer ruled supreme. They were great days,\\nthose eighteenth-century days,--\"When men had longer breaths and voices\\nthat never grew old, when strange and terrible things still happened,\\nsapphire rings presented them by the demon, processions to welcome them,\\nand violent deaths by murder or in brawls.\" The singers had contributed\\nlargely in forming the lyric drama, but their demands became exorbitant\\nand the composer was their slave. The introduction of castrates on the\\nstage was of special influence in shaping the operatic conditions. Take\\nany _opera seria_ of that day: it consists simply of a series of detached\\nairs strung together by the poet\\'s story. There was no dramatic action;\\nthere was simply an operatic concert. The _prima donna_ was the queen\\nof the theatre; she claimed the privilege of the escort of a page when\\nshe made her entrance; he held the train of her robe and followed every\\nmovement. The tenor was obliged to be either a noble father, a traitor or\\ntyrant. The _basso_ was restricted to _opera buffa_, for it was thought\\nthat his voice was naturally too \"grotesque\" to be heard in _opera seria_.\\nThe castrate was the monarch of the scene. Singularly enough, he was\\ncalled the _primo uomo_, and to him was given the lover\\'s part. His very\\nperson was sacred on the stage. Others might slay and be slain; he was\\ninviolable, and his head was always crowned with laurel. It was the rule\\nin Italy, never to admit the murder of the chief singer, although the\\npiece itself might reek with blood. These male sopranos were spoiled\\nchildren. One must make his appearance upon a horse; another insisted on\\ndescending from a mountain; another would not sing unless his plume was\\nfive feet in length. The moment they finished their airs, they left the\\nstage, or remained upon it sucking oranges or drinking wine. They made\\ntheir demands on the composer; he was obliged to write a bravura aria,\\nor an air _di portamento_ with perhaps a trumpet obligato, according to\\ntheir caprice. They robbed their associates of their airs if they saw a\\npossible distribution of glory. The chief singer and the composer between\\nthem made the opera, for there was but little ensemble work. The custom\\nwas to finish the second act with a duet between the castrate and the\\nfirst soprano; to end the third by a terzetto in which the first tenor\\nwas admitted. Gretry tells us that during the seven or eight years he\\nlived in Rome, he never saw a serious opera succeed. \"If the theatre was\\ncrowded, it was to hear a certain singer; and when the singer left the\\nstage, the people in the boxes played cards or ate ices, and the people\\nin the parterre yawned.\" And Voltaire summed up the whole matter when he\\nwrote M. de Cideville (1752) that \"the opera is a public rendezvous where\\npeople meet on certain days without knowing why; it is a house which is\\nfrequented by everybody, although the master is freely cursed and the\\ncrowd bored.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: PRIZE MODEL FOR NEW MONUMENT TO MOZART IN VIENNA.\\n\\nReproduced from a photograph.]\\n\\nIt was different in _opera buffa_. In this species of opera the virtuosos\\nwere not so powerful as the poet and the composer. The castrate could\\nnot afford to waste his time in consorting with the \"_bouffons_,\" and so\\nhis place was taken by the tenor, who became the passionate lover. In\\nlike manner the _prima donna_, was paid such a small sum that the manager\\nwas obliged to look for women of ambition and dramatic talent instead of\\nacknowledged vocal skill. The _basso_ was admitted to the company, and\\nhere was the foundation of an ensemble impossible in grand opera. The\\n_opera seria_ remained in its conventional or ideal world; the _opera\\nbuffa_ was concerned with subjects of everyday life. The former clung to\\nhistory or legend; the latter delighted in appealing to the life of the\\npeople. The composer was allowed more liberty. He was not confined to the\\n_da capo_ air, composed of two parts with the invariable repetition of\\nthe first; he could use the rondo, where the chief melody appears after\\neach secondary theme; or the cavatina, with one movement; or the chanson\\nwith its simple couplet; in other words, he could better suit the dramatic\\naction. He wrote duets, trios, quartets of importance, and gradually the\\nfinale was developed. So too the orchestra, which had been subordinated to\\nthe imperious singer in _opera seria_, found its voice, and even sang in\\npassages where the text demanded of the singer a rapid delivery that was\\nalmost dramatic speech. The _opera buffa_ rapidly grew in public favor,\\nand Arteaga in his famous book on the \"Revolution of Italian Dramatic\\nMusic\" frankly confessed that the _opera buffa_ was in better condition\\nand gave greater promise than its more pretentious rival.\\n\\nThe first attempts of Mozart in dramatic composition do not call for\\nspecial attention. They were in the conventional style of the day, and\\nthe librettos were wretched. Two of them \"Bastien et Bastienne\" and \"La\\nfinta Giardiniera\" were revived in Germany in 1892 and with considerable\\nsuccess. In the latter the characters are well defined; the melody is\\nspontaneous; there is color; and the finales are well developed. But in\\n\"Idomeneo\" (1781) we first see the peculiar dramatic genius of Mozart.\\nThere is still the formalism of the _opera seria_, but there are traces\\nof the influence of French dramatic sincerity, and of his own artistic\\nindividuality. Jahn has described the opera as \"the genuine Italian _opera\\nseria_ brought to its utmost perfection by Mozart\\'s highly cultivated\\nindividuality.\" The chorus is brought into prominence; the instrumentation\\nis richer than in contemporaneous works, and there are evidences of the\\nstudy of Gluck, as in the accompaniment of three trombones and two horns\\nin the proclaiming of the oracle of Neptune. That he was convinced at the\\ntime of the superiority of French taste in dramatic music, as in truth of\\ndiction and sincerity, is shown by the fact that he wished to bring it\\nout in Vienna rearranged after the French model. And it may here be said\\nthat if Mozart in the formation of his song was strongly influenced by\\nItalian spirit, he was also deeply impressed by the sense of proportion,\\nthat was characteristic of French opera of his day. Gretry had shown great\\nart in the connecting of the operatic scenes, translating faithfully the\\nspoken word into musical speech, and individualizing by musical means the\\ncreatures of the play. It was reserved for Mozart, the greater genius,\\nto carry Gretry\\'s theories farther and at the same time never lose sight\\nof the musical expression. Mehul once said that Gretry made wit and not\\nmusic; this reproach could not justly be made against Mozart, although\\nhe walked in the same path with the author of \"Le Tableau parlant\" and\\n\"Richard.\" In spite of both the French and Italian influences, there\\nwas much that was novel in the expression of the phrase, the variety of\\nthematic development, and the modulation, harmony, and instrumentation.\\nIts first performance was an epoch in the history of opera.\\n\\nIn the \"Escape from the Seraglio\" (1782) there was a still greater\\nadvance, and here is seen the beginning of what is now known as German\\nopera. Mozart, while composing it, wrote his father at various times\\nconcerning his operatic creed. Quotations from these letters will perhaps\\nbest explain his theories: \"A man who abandons himself to his anger,\\nbecomes extravagant and is no longer master of himself. If music paints\\nanger, it must imitate its model; and however violent the passions may be\\nthey should never provoke disgust. Music ought never to wound the ear.\\nEven in the most horrible situations it ought to satisfy the ear. Music\\nshould always remain music.\" Here it will be seen that he is with La Harpe\\nand against Gluck. \"Poetry in opera should be the obedient daughter of\\nmusic. Why do the Italian operas, in spite of miserable texts, please\\neverywhere, even in Paris? Because the music dominates as sovereign and\\neverything else is accepted.\" Here again Mozart is directly opposed to\\nGluck; the former is the disciple of the Italian school; the latter\\nfaithful to the French theory. Perhaps, as Victor Wilder suggests, the\\ntruth is between the two extreme points; poetry and music in opera are\\nnecessarily in reciprocal independence, and each ought in turn to dominate\\nthe other, as the action hastens or is at a standstill. Gluck himself\\nadmitted that \"the union between words and music should be so close that\\nthe poem seems as much made for the music as the music for the poem.\" Now\\nItalian dramatic music was chiefly concerned with the whole effect of\\nthe poetical thought; the French was more concerned with the detail; the\\nGerman was more allied to the symphony, and there was a more even balance\\nbetween the vocal melody and the instrumental phrase. (It will be borne\\nin mind that I speak of German opera as it existed before the theories\\nand work of Richard Wagner.) As \"Idomeneo\" is distinguished by choral\\ndignity and French frankness of dramatic expression, the \"Escape from the\\nSeraglio\" is characterized by exquisite melody, by delightful ensemble,\\nand by ingenious instrumentation. There is an exuberance, a freshness in\\nthis opera, that led von Weber to affirm that here Mozart had reached \"the\\nfull maturity of his powers as an artist, and that his further progress\\nafter that was only in knowledge of the world.\" It would be an interesting\\ntask to show the growth of Mozart\\'s dramatic genius as seen in this\\nglorification of the old German Singspiel; the characterization of the\\ndifferent parts by musical means. His letters to his father show the pains\\nhe took in the instrumentation, now seeking with triangle, big drum and\\ncymbals Turkish effects, now emphasizing the sighs of Belmont with muted\\nstrings and the flute.\\n\\nRossini once said that his \"Barbiere\" was an _opera buffa_, while Mozart\\nin \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" gave the model of the _dramma giocoso_: a fine\\ndistinction, worthy of the shrewdness of the author. This Italian\\nadaptation of a French comedy set to music by a German differs from\\nthe accepted form of _opera buffa_, in the development of the plot and\\nthe delineation of character. The opera is at once dramatic, comic and\\nmusical, not merely a bundle of comic situations and gross caricature with\\nincidental music. Rossini\\'s \"Barbiere,\" a masterpiece for all time, is\\nundoubtedly the truer reflection of the spirit of Beaumarchais; for Mozart\\nhas idealized the intrigues and characters of the play. The libretto of da\\nPonte is admirable in spite of the omission of the political satire that\\nperhaps justifies the immorality of the play. In this opera the musical\\ncharacter-drawing is most cunning. Susanna and Marcellina are jealous,\\nbut how different is their common jealousy from the noble jealousy of\\nthe Countess. Rossini has drawn the Countess in her youth and made her a\\nmischievous and rebellious child. Mozart finds her a loving and abused\\nwife, who does not encourage the page\\'s advances, but, suffering, yet not\\nwithout hope, seeks to win back her husband\\'s love. In Susanna\\'s passion\\nthere is a tinge of sensuality, but the music given her by Mozart is nobly\\nsensuous. And so her merriment, her teasing, her caprices are all fitly\\nexpressed. The Cherubino of Beaumarchais is a wanton youth who looks with\\namorous eye upon all women; but his fever is turned into absorbing and\\ntrembling love when he is in the presence of Mozart\\'s Countess. So too\\nthe men are carefully distinguished. The music given to each one of the\\ncharacters can not be mistaken; it surrounds each like an atmosphere.\\nThis characterization is clearly seen in the masterly finales. Take the\\neight movements, each distinct in design, that form the finale of the\\nsecond act. Succeeding complications as the number of persons in the\\naction increases; different emotions, as jealousy, merriment, anger,\\nforgiveness; the entrance and denunciation of the drunken gardener; the\\narrival of Marcellina and her confederates; all these seemingly opposing\\nelements are firmly bound together and knit into an harmonious whole\\nthat constantly increases in dramatic and musical strength. The other\\ngreat finale, a succession of misunderstandings and surprises is almost\\nequally remarkable, and the sextet, which according to Kelly was Mozart\\'s\\nfavorite piece in the whole opera, is not far below it. All these ensemble\\nnumbers are at the same time so skilfully constructed that there is an\\nappearance of utter freedom of dramatic action. No words can give an\\nidea of the wealth of melody, a wealth that is prodigally squandered,\\nand yet this melody enhances the dramatic truth and does not stifle\\nit. The instrumentation is always appropriate to the scenic effect. It\\nsupplements the voice. Whenever the same subject is used in a great\\nnumber of recitatives, there is an astonishing variety of instrumental\\nexpression. It is said that Mozart\\'s contemporaries were particularly\\nstruck by his employment of wind instruments, as in the accompaniment to\\nCherubino\\'s romanze and air. And yet how simple the means; how meager\\nthe resources would seem to young composers of to-day who even in comic\\noperas feel obliged to use the trombones and drums for the accompaniment\\nof the slightest recitative. In this opera the orchestra takes its\\nrightful place, it does not seek to dominate. It is always conscious of\\nthe action on the stage, but it is not envious; it gladly assists, and\\nstrengthens the impression. Its tone-colors aid in the distinguishing of\\nthe characters. And above all, in the orchestra as well as on the stage,\\nthere is ever present the sense of dramatic truth and unerring instinct in\\nthe expression of it.\\n\\nThe libretto of \"Don Giovanni\" has been often censured, and without real\\njustice; for nearly all the feelings of humanity are expressed by the\\ncharacters. The supernatural, the vulgar, tragedy and comedy are mixed\\ntogether; even in the scene where the rake-helly hero plunges into eternal\\nflames, the element of farce is present. Beethoven, it is true, thought\\nthe subject a scandalous one, unworthy of musical treatment; but it was\\nadmirably adapted to the dramatic temperament of Mozart. \"Don Giovanni\\nis a temperament of flame and fire that has no time for monologues; he\\nacts; it is life without shackles, without curb, flowing as the lava of a\\nvolcano, which destroys everything in its path.\"\\n\\nThe various scenes, the conflicting passions, are marvellously reproduced\\nin the music of Mozart. From the very opening where Leporello keeps\\nimpatient watch to the unearthly scene between the Statue and the\\nlibertine, there is an unceasing flow of exquisite melody that is not\\nonly appropriate to the characters and the action, but is also the\\nfullest and most complete expression of the plot and incidents. Berlioz\\nobjected to the florid air sung by Donna Anna, on the ground that it was\\nnot essentially dramatic; but there have been singers who could express\\npassion in a roulade and sway the hearer by a trill; such is the power of\\npersonal conviction. It is true that the last finale is an anti-climax.\\nThe interest ceases with the punishment of the hero, and although\\nattempts have been made to give the opera with this finale, they have not\\nbeen successful; and the curtain rightly falls with the descent of Don\\nGiovanni. To speak in detail of the myriad beauties of this masterpiece\\nwould be simply to analyze the score measure by measure. Its immortal\\nmelodies are known throughout the world. Musicians of all schools have\\nvied with men eminent in the other walks of life in the most extravagant\\neulogy. In this opera is seen the universality of Mozart\\'s genius. His\\nknowledge of humanity, his sympathy with all classes and conditions of\\nmen. It is the most realistic of his works; it is at the same time the\\nmost ideal. Not without reason did Goethe pass over Cherubini and von\\nWeber, Auber and Rossini, Beethoven and the rest, and say that Mozart was\\nthe one who should have set his Faust to music. Not without reason did he\\nmention him with Shakespeare.\\n\\n\"Cosi fan tutte\" and \"La Clemenza di Tito\" were written hurriedly. Neither\\nis an advance in the career of the composer. The first is a return to\\nthe old-fashioned _opera buffa_; the second looks longingly towards the\\nancient _opera seria_. The plot of the former is vulgar, improbable and\\nstupid; and that of the latter is extremely dull. The music of \"Cosi fan\\ntutte\" is often delightful, as in the famous quintet, the second terzet;\\nbut there is not the same degree of psychological characterization found\\nin his three great operas; and there are many concessions to popular\\ntaste. \"La Clemenza di Tito\" belongs to that class of compositions\\ndescribed by the French as _grandes machines officielles_. The finale is\\nworthy of Mozart; but as a whole the opera is inferior to \"Idomeneo\" even\\nin the instrumentation.\\n\\nWhen Schikaneder learned that Marinelli, a rival manager, also thought\\nof putting on the stage a fairy drama made out of Wieland\\'s \"Lulu,\" he\\nchanged the plot of his \"Magic flute\" and substituted for the evil genius\\nof the play the high priest Sarastro, who appears to be custodian of the\\nsecrets and the executor of the wishes of the masonic order. The libretto\\nhas been ruthlessly condemned by many for its obscurity, absurdity,\\ntriviality and buffoonery. Certain writers, however, have found a deep\\nand symbolical meaning in the most frivolous dialogue and even in the\\nmusic of the overture. Some have gone so far as to regard the opera as\\na symbolical representation of the French Revolution: with the Queen of\\nNight as the incarnation of royalty; Pamina as Liberty, for whom Tamino,\\nthe People, burns with passionate love; Sarastro as the Wisdom of the\\nLegislature. Others have claimed that no one who was not a Freemason could\\nappreciate the merits of the libretto at their true value. Now, Mozart\\nhimself saw nothing in the text but the story of a magic opera. Goethe\\nand Hegel were equally blind. The former once wrote of the text that \"the\\nauthor understood perfectly the art of producing great theatrical effects\\nby contrasts,\" and Hegel praised the libretto highly for its mixture of\\nthe supernatural and the common, for its episodes of the initiations and\\nthe tests. Rubinstein likes the variety: \"pathetic, fantastic, lyric,\\ncomic, naive, romantic, dramatic, tragic, yes, it would be hard to find\\nan expression that is wanting in it. It is evident the genius of a Mozart\\nwas required to reproduce it all musically, as he has done; but such\\ntexts might incite less genial composers to interesting work.\" But who\\nin listening to the music heeds Tamino pursued by the snake, the gloomy\\nQueen, or the vengeance of the Moor? Who is disquieted by the padlock or\\nthe glockenspiel? He listens to the overture and forgets the \"prodigious\\ncomplexity\" in \"its clearness, fascination and irresistible effect,\" and\\nhe says with Saint Saens, \"it is a _tour de force_ which Mozart only could\\nhave accomplished.\" He laughs with Papageno; he woos with Tamino; he is\\ninitiated into the solemn mysteries. He does not understand the plot; he\\ndoes not desire to understand it; for his mind and his senses are soothed\\nby the continual and varied melody. As regards the instrumentation Jahn\\nhas condensed all criticism into this one sentence: \"It is the point of\\ndeparture for all that modern music has achieved in this direction.\" Nor\\ncan the influence which the opera has exerted in the formation of German\\nmusic be overrated. For the first time all the resources of great genius\\nwere brought to bear upon a genuine German opera. No one has summed up so\\ntersely and so fully the operatic genius of Mozart as Rubinstein: \"Gluck\\nhad achieved great things in the opera before him; yes, opened new paths,\\nbut in comparison with Mozart he is, so to say, of stone. Besides, Mozart\\nhas the merit of having removed the opera from the icy pathos of mythology\\ninto real life, into the purely human, and from the Italian to the German\\nlanguage, and thereby to a national path. The most remarkable feature of\\nhis operas is the musical characteristic he has given to every figure, so\\nthat each acting personage has become an immortal type. That which he has\\nmade, he alone could make: a god-like creation, all flooded with light. In\\nhearing Mozart I always wish to exclaim: \\'Eternal sunshine in music, thy\\nname is Mozart!\\'\"\\n\\nMozart once said in regard to his lesser works, \"Woe to the man that\\njudges me by these trifles.\" But the skill in instrumentation, the\\nheaven-born song, the spontaneity of counterpoint, and the exquisite sense\\nof proportion are often displayed in the serenades and _divertimenti_.\\nAnd in these qualities of art he still reigns supreme. It is true that he\\nfounded no school in the narrow sense of the word; but he smoothed the\\npath for Beethoven; and without him the noble line in direct succession\\nwould have been of later birth. It is idle, and yet it is common in these\\ndays, to compare a composer of one generation, or even of a century, with\\nthe composer of earlier or later years. Music itself is in a measure the\\nexpression of its time. When counterpoint was regarded as the only medium\\nof music, the opera itself was stiffened by its contrapuntal dress, and\\nreligion could only find vent in a fugue. When the singer waxed arrogant,\\nmusic existed only for his vain glory. Now we are taught to believe that\\nabsolute music, music that does not \"paint\" or \"personate\" or follow a\\n\"program,\" is of little account; that unless it puts in clearer light\\nsome poetical thought or some determined emotion or natural phenomenon,\\nit is worthless; that music is not merely the vehicle of musical thought,\\nbut is rather a means of expressing many ideas that might be better\\nexpressed in poetry, in prose, or on the canvas. So the times change and\\nwith them the fashions in art of every species. There is then perhaps no\\ngreatest composer. Plutarchian comparisons between the men of different\\ncenturies are of little avail in determining true values. A man must be\\njudged by the conditions of his own time and compared with the men who\\nworked by his side. And what compositions of Mozart\\'s day, instrumental\\nor operatic, have stood the test of the revenger Time? Even the mighty\\nGluck with his noble theories and statuesque music has bowed the knee\\nto the younger rival. Figaro and Papageno and the dissolute Don Juan\\nTenorio y Salazar live to-day upon the stage; they are as familiar as\\nthe characters of the Old Testament; as Robinson Crusoe or Don Quixote;\\nthey are immortalized by the genius of the music-maker of Vienna. It may\\nbe said without exaggeration that no composer began his work with such a\\nnatural endowment; that Nature created him the greatest musician. His dear\\nfriend Haydn, a man not given to vain compliments, a man of hard sense,\\ndeclared that posterity would not see such talent as his for the next\\nhundred years. And Rossini at the height of his glory, conscious of his\\nown prodigious natural gifts, pronounced the final judgment so far as this\\ncentury is concerned: \"He is the greatest, he is the master of us all.\\nHe is the only one whose genius was as great as his knowledge, and whose\\nknowledge equalled his genius.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Signature: Philip Hale]\\n\\n[Illustration: The Graces.

In\\nthe 14th century it was the capital of the Duchy of Brabant, the residence\\nof the princes, the home of 2,000 manufactories. Near this city, whose\\nruin was wrought by turbulent weavers, are villages called Rotselaer,\\nLeefdæl, and Berthem; and in the 16th century people by the name of\\nVan Beethoven were found in these same villages or hard by. If Leon de\\nBurbure\\'s researches are not in vain, these Van Beethovens were simple\\nFlemish peasants, who ate beans during the week, and on a Sunday welcomed\\nthe sight of bacon. _Van_ is not in Dutch a sign of nobility. Nor was the\\nspelling of the name invariable. It was Biethoven, Biethoffen, Bethof,\\nBetthoven; and there were other variations.\\n\\nAbout 1650 one of these farmers grew weary of the smell of fresh earth\\nand the life with the beasts of the field, and he entered into Antwerp to\\nmake his fortune. There he married, begot a son, and named him Guillaume;\\nand Guillaume was the great-great-grandfather of the composer of the Nine\\nSymphonies. Guillaume, or Wilhelm, grew up, trafficked in wines, was\\napparently a man of parts, and was held in esteem. He married Catherine\\nGrandjean. He named one of his eight children Henri-Adelard, and this\\nHenri, the godson of the Baron de Rocquigny, became a prominent tailor,\\nand wedded Catherine de Herdt, by whom he had a dozen children. The third,\\na son, was baptized Dec. 23, 1712, and his name was Louis. Louis was\\nbrought up in the Antwerp choirs, and there seems to be no doubt that he\\nreceived a thorough musical education. His father, Henri, a year after\\nthe birth of Louis, fell into poverty, and it is probable that the boy,\\nfollowing the fortunes of some choir-master, lived for a time at Ghent.\\nIn 1731 he was a singer in Louvain. In 1733 he was named a musician of\\nthe court of the Elector of Cologne at Bonn. His salary was fixed at\\nabout $160, and he married, in September, 1733, Maria Josepha Poll, aged\\nnineteen. Louis, or Ludwig, prospered. He rose from \"Musicus\" to \"Herr\\nKapellmeister.\" Maria, his wife, with increasing good fortune and the\\naddition of a wine shop to music lessons, took to drink, and died in 1775\\nin a convent at Cologne. Johann, their son, born towards the end of 1739\\nor in the beginning of 1740, inherited her thirst. He sang tenor and\\nreceived his appointment as court singer March 27, 1756. For thirteen\\nyears he had served without pay as soprano, contralto, and tenor, and in\\n1764 he was granted one hundred thalers by Maximilian Friedrich, who had\\nsucceeded Clemens August as Elector. In 1767 he married Maria Magdalena\\nKewerich, the widow of Johann Laym, a valet. Maria was the daughter of a\\nhead cook, nineteen, comely, slender, soft-hearted. Old Ludwig objected\\nto the match on account of the low social position of the woman. The\\nyoung couple lived in the house No. 515 in the Bonngasse. Ludwig Maria\\nwas born in 1769 and lived six days. Ludwig, the great composer, was\\nbaptized the 17th of December, 1770, and he was probably born the day\\nbefore the baptism. Of the five children born afterward, only Caspar Anton\\n(1774-1815) and Nikolaus Johann (1776-1848) grew up. A brother, August,\\nlived two years; a sister, Anna, four days, and Maria Margaretha about a\\nyear.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN\\'S BIRTHPLACE IN BONN.]\\n\\nThe seat of the electoral government of Cologne was transferred in 1257\\nfrom Cologne to Bonn. The ecclesiastical principality was a source of\\nlarge revenue to the Elector, and his income was derived from rights of\\nexcise and navigation, church dues, benefits of games and lotteries,\\nand secret sums paid the Elector by Austria and France for serving\\ntheir interests. The Elector was also powerful in politics, and he\\nhad the privilege of putting Charlemagne\\'s crown on the head of the\\nemperor at Aix-la-Chapelle. The founder of the musical organization in\\nBonn was Joseph Clemens, ugly, humpbacked, witty, fond of practical\\njokes, music-mad. He was continually chasing after artists of merit.\\nHe introduced French and Flemish musicians. In 1722 the state of the\\nelectoral music-chapel was as follows: a director-in-chief of singing, and\\ntwo concert-masters; six musicians who were sub-chiefs, organists, etc.;\\ntwelve singers, men and women, and to them must be added choir boys, and\\nassistants chosen from the domestics of the court; seventeen players of\\nstringed instruments; four trumpets, two horns and two drums; six players\\nof oboes and bassoons. Joseph died in 1724. Clemens August succeeded\\nhim, and shared his musical taste. He in turn was followed in 1761 by\\nMaximilian Friedrich, whose habits were sumptuous; but his prime minister\\ncut down the expenses. He dismissed comedians, lessened the number of\\nconcerts, and so the Beethoven family suffered in pocket.\\n\\nThe death of the first grandchild healed the breach between old Ludwig\\nand Johann. The old man died in 1773, but his grandson Ludwig remembered\\nhim and preserved his portrait painted by Radoux to the day of his own\\ndeath. Dressed in court costume and wrapped in a red cloak, with great and\\nsparkling eyes, he made an indelible impression on the three-year-old boy,\\nas on his neighbors, who respected and admired him. It was his father who\\nfirst taught Ludwig the rudiments of his art. It is said, and the reports\\nare unanimous, that when the boy was hardly four years old, he was obliged\\nto practise for hours on the pianoforte, and was often urged by blows.\\nHe was soon put under the instruction of Tobias Pfeiffer, the tenor of a\\nstrolling company. Pfeiffer was a good musician and a man of unquenchable\\nthirst. Johann and he would spend hours in the tavern; and Pfeiffer,\\nsuddenly remembering that his pupil had received no lesson that day,\\nwould return home, drag him from his bed, and keep him at the instrument\\nuntil daybreak. Or, locked in a room, young Ludwig practised the violin,\\nand he was kept there until he had finished the daily allotted task. At\\nthe primary school he learned to read, write, and reckon. Before he was\\nthirteen, his father declared that his scholastic education was finished.\\nThis limited education was a source of mortification to Beethoven\\nthroughout his life, and no doubt influenced strongly his character. He\\nspelled atrociously, he was never sure of the proper expression, and the\\nwasherwoman disputed angrily his addition and subtraction.\\n\\nAfter the death of the grandfather poverty entered the house. The\\nsecond-hand buyer became the warm friend of the family, and the household\\nfurniture fed Johann\\'s appetite. In response to a singular petition of\\nthe tenor, a pension of sixty thalers was granted to the poor woman in\\nthe convent at Cologne, who died a few months after it was given to\\nher. Beethoven\\'s patient mother was always sewing and mending, and the\\nbaker at least was paid. Meanwhile Johann meditated over his cups the\\npossibility of fortune gained by his son. Pfeiffer left Bonn. The boy\\ntook a few lessons of Van den Eeden. They were gratuitous; the teacher\\nwas old and infirm; and Neefe, who succeeded Van den Eeden, took charge\\nof Ludwig and gave him his first instruction in composition. Neefe was\\nan excellent musician. The son of a tailor, he first studied law, and\\ngained the title of \"Doctor\" by his thesis \"A father has no right to\\ndisinherit his son because the latter has turned opera-singer.\" Now Neefe\\nleft on record a description of Ludwig at the age of eleven, which was\\npublished in Cramer\\'s Music Magazine. According to him Beethoven played\\nthe pianoforte with \"energetic skill.\" He played \"fluently\" Bach\\'s\\n\"Well-tempered Clavichord.\" \"To encourage him he had nine variations which\\nthe child wrote on a march theme engraved at Mannheim. This young genius\\ndeserves a subsidy that he may travel. If he goes on as he has begun, he\\nwill certainly be a second Mozart.\" Years after, Beethoven acknowledged\\ngladly his many obligations to this master. In 1782 Neefe went to Munster\\nfor a visit, and Ludwig, then eleven years and a half old, took his place\\nat the organ. In the following year he was promoted to the position of\\n_maestro al cembalo_, i.e., he assisted at operatic rehearsals and played\\nthe pianoforte at the performances. During these years, operas by Gretry,\\nPiccini, Cimarosa, Guglielmi, Sacchini, Sarti, Monsigny, Gluck, and Mozart\\nwere given. According to the recollections of those who then knew him, he\\nwas sombre, melancholy. He did not enter into the sports of his age. Once\\na year he assisted in the celebration of the birthday of his mother. There\\nwas music, there was drinking, and there was eating; there was dancing in\\nstockings, so that the neighbors might not be disturbed.\\n\\n[Illustration: Beethoven\\'s first authenticated likeness--a silhouette by\\nNeesen, made between 1787 and 1789.]\\n\\nIn 1783, Beethoven published the first three sonatas, dedicated to\\nthe Elector. A year after, he was named second-organist, through the\\nintervention of Neefe and Count Salm, but \"without appointments.\"\\nMaximilian died in 1784, and Maximilian of Austria, the brother of Marie\\nAntoinette, ruled in his stead. He at once began the work of reforming the\\ncourt-music. In a record of the day, Johann is spoken of as a worn-out\\nsinger, \"but he has been long in service and is very poor.\" Ludwig is\\nreferred to as a possible successor to Neefe, and they could secure him\\nfor about $60 a year. \"He is poor, very young, and the son of a court\\nmusician.\" In July, 1784, Ludwig was awarded a salary of $60, although\\nNeefe was not removed; and at the installation of the new Elector in 1785,\\nthe boy, in court dress with sword at side, was permitted to kiss the\\nhands of his august master.\\n\\nAt that time Bonn was a sleepy town of about 10,000 inhabitants, who were\\nchiefly priests and people of the court. There were no factories; there\\nwas no garrison, and the only soldiers were the body guard of the elector.\\nThe theatre was in a wing of the palace. Strolling companies tarried there\\nfor a season. Concerts, or \"academies,\" as they were called, were given\\nin a handsome hall. The musicians lived bunched together in a quarter of\\nthe town. Franz Ries, the violinist; the horn player, Simrock, the founder\\nof the publishing house; the singing daughters of Salomon;--these worthy\\npeople were neighbors of the Beethovens. There were many skilled amateurs\\nin society. The Elector himself was passionately fond of music; he played\\nthe viola and the pianoforte.\\n\\nThere is a story that in 1781, Ludwig made a concert tour in Holland,\\nor at least played in Rotterdam, but, with this possible exception, he\\ndid not leave Bonn from his birth until the spring of 1787, and then he\\nwent to Vienna. The Elector probably paid the expenses, and he gave him a\\nletter to Mozart. This great composer was apt to look askew at any infant\\nphenomenon. He listened at first impatiently to the playing of Beethoven,\\nbut when the latter invented a fantasia on a given theme, Mozart said to\\nthe hearers, \"Pay attention to this youngster; he will make a noise in\\nthe world, one of these days.\" He gave the boy a few lessons. There is a\\nstory that Beethoven also met the Emperor Joseph. His stay was cut short\\nby lack of money and the news that his mother was dying. In July, Franz\\nRies paid her burial expenses. Johann kept on drinking, and his son, who\\nwas now the head of the house, rescued him occasionally from the hands\\nof the police. In 1789 it was decreed that a portion of the father\\'s\\nsalary should be paid to the son, and December 18, 1792, the unfortunate\\nman died. The Elector, in a letter to Marshall Schall, pronounced this\\nfuneral oration: \"Beethoven is dead; it is a serious loss to the duties on\\nspirits.\"\\n\\nLudwig looked after the education of his brothers; Caspar learned music,\\nand Johann was put under the Court Apothecary. And now he found devoted\\nfriends in Count Waldstein and the Breuning family. The widow von Breuning\\nwas a woman of society, accomplished and kind-hearted. She was one of\\nthe few people who had an influence over the actions of Beethoven, and\\nher influence was no doubt strengthened by the sweetness of her daughter\\nEleonore. He gave Eleonore lessons, and she in turn acquainted him with\\nthe German poets, and Homer and Shakespeare. Was he in love with her?\\nWe know that he was of amorous temperament. Dr. Wegeler, Stephen von\\nBreuning, Ries, Romberg, all bear witness that he was never without an\\nobject of passion in his heart. Mr. Thayer says that we have no proof\\nthat Beethoven loved her, but such affairs are not often matters for\\ncross-examination and a jury. No doubt the susceptible young man was\\nsmitten deeply with every fair girl he met, and in the new-comer forgot\\nthe old flame. There was Miss Jeannette d\\'Honrath of Cologne; there was\\nMiss Westerhold, whose eyes he remembered for forty years; nor must pretty\\nBabette Koch be forgotten, the daughter of a tavern keeper, and afterward\\na Countess. And so he passed his days in music, conversation, and innocent\\npleasures. He went with the Elector to Mergentheim; at Aschaffenburg he\\nplayed in friendly rivalry with the Abbe Sterkel. It was at Mergentheim\\nthat the modest and unassuming pianist touched hearts by his telling,\\nsuggestive, expressive improvisations; for so Chaplain Junker bore record.\\nIn 1792, Haydn passed through Bonn on his return from London to Vienna,\\nand praised a cantata by Beethoven on the succession of Leopold II.,\\nand in November of the same year Ludwig left Bonn for ever. The Elector\\nrealized the extent of his genius, and gave him a small pension. The\\npolitical condition of France affected the Rhenish town; there was panic,\\nand in October there was a general exodus. His many friends bade Beethoven\\nwarm God-speed, and Count Waldstein in a letter prayed him to receive\\n\"through unbroken industry from the hands of Haydn the spirit of Mozart.\"\\nNearly twenty-two, he was known chiefly by the remarkable facility of his\\nextempore playing, and the record of his compositions during the Bonn\\nperiod is insignificant. At the age of twenty-three, Mozart was famous as\\na writer of operas, symphonies, cantatas, and masses, and his pieces were\\nin number about three hundred.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nMiniature portrait on ivory painted by C. Hernemann, in 1802.]\\n\\nOn his arrival at Vienna he bought clothing and took dancing lessons, that\\nhe might be an acceptable guest in houses to which he was recommended by\\nCount Waldstein. He never was able to dance, by the way, for he could not\\nkeep step to the music. The 12th of December, he recorded the fact that\\nhe had only about $35. The Elector, fearing hard times, did not fulfill\\nhis first promises. Beethoven took a garret,--and afterwards moved to\\na room on the ground-floor--in a printer\\'s house in the Alservorstadt;\\nthere he began a student-life of three years. He took lessons of Haydn,\\nand although they drank coffee and chocolate at Beethoven\\'s expense,\\nthe lessons were unsatisfactory. Haydn looked on the pupil as a musical\\natheist, who had not the fear of Fux before his eyes, and the pupil\\nthought that Haydn was not diligent and that he did not correct carefully\\nhis mistakes. \"It is true he gave me lessons,\" he once said to Ries,\\n\"but he taught me nothing.\" Then he took secretly lessons of Schenk,\\nand when Haydn went to London in 1794, he put himself under the rigid\\ndisciplinarian Albrechtsberger. He studied with Salieri the art of\\nwriting for the voice and the stage. He also took lessons on the viola,\\nviolin, violoncello, clarinet and horn. There were a few exceptions, but\\nBeethoven was unpopular with his masters. They considered him obstinate\\nand arrogant. Haydn spoke of him as \"the great Mogul\"; Albrechtsberger\\nonce said, \"He has learned nothing, and will never do anything in decent\\nstyle.\" Nor was Beethoven\\'s continual \"_I_ say it is right\" calculated to\\nwin the affection of his masters.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN AND MOZART.\\n\\nReproduced from a photograph of a painting in which the two composers are\\nnot faithfully represented, as may be seen by referring to authenticated\\nportraits.]\\n\\nMeanwhile Beethoven made influential friends. Vienna at that time numbered\\nabout 250,000 inhabitants. The life was gay, even frivolous. Reichardt\\nconsidered the city a most agreeable dwelling place for musicians. \"You\\nfind there a rich, educated, and hospitable aristocracy, devoted to music;\\nthe middle class is wealthy and intelligent; and the common people,\\njolly and good-natured, have always a song in the mouth.\" Princes hired\\norchestra and singers for their own theatres. Others had musicians in\\ntheir employment, and even those in moderate circumstances retained an\\norganist or pianist. These Viennese were the patrons of composers who\\nwrote especially for them. In common with other South Germans they were\\npleased with music that appealed to the heart rather than to the brain,\\nand the neighborhood of Italy influenced their melodies and taste. This\\ninfluence was also marked in the sympathetic performance of the Vienna\\nplayers, for the abandon and the swing were opposed to the rigidity of\\nNorthern orchestras. The amateurs were many and of the noblest families.\\nThere was Van Swieten who bowed the knee to Handel; Count Kinsky, whose\\nson was in after years the devoted friend of Beethoven; Prince Lobkowitz,\\nwho played the violin and spent his fortune in the pursuit of musical\\npleasure; the Esterhazy family; Von Rees and Von Meyer; and princes and\\ncounts without number, in whose houses symphonies, oratorios, and chamber\\nmusic were performed from manuscript. Public concerts were then rare. The\\ncourt opera house was devoted to Italian opera; at the Theatre Marinelli\\nGerman operettas were seen; at the theatre _an der Wien_, farces and\\noperettas were given. The chief composers in Vienna were Haydn, Salieri,\\nWeizl, Schenk, Sussmayr, Wranitzky, Kozeluch, Forster, Eberl and Vanhall.\\n\\nTwo of the warmest friends of Beethoven were the Prince Lichnowsky and his\\nwife, formerly the Countess of Thun. They mourned the death of Mozart, and\\nsaw in Haydn\\'s pupil a possible successor. In 1794 they took Beethoven\\nto their house and humored him and petted him. They were childless, and\\ntheir affection was spent on the rude, hot-tempered, trying young man.\\nThe princess saw through the rugged exterior, and the stories of her\\ntact and forbearance are many. \"She would have put me in a glass case\\nthat no evil might come nigh me,\" said the composer in after years. In\\ntheir palace Beethoven was free in action and in dress. He studied or\\ngave lessons by day, and at night he was associated with the Schuppanzigh\\nquartet--afterward the Rasoumoffsky quartet--the members of which met\\nevery Friday at Lichnowsky\\'s house.\\n\\nAt this time he was chiefly known as a virtuoso, and his first appearance\\nin public was March 29, 1795, in a concert at the Burgtheatre for the\\nbenefit of the widows of the Society of Musicians. An oratorio by\\nCartellieri was given, and Beethoven played his pianoforte concerto in C\\nmajor, which was published six years after as Op. 15. At rehearsal there\\nwas a difference of half a tone between the pitch of the pianoforte and\\nthat of the orchestral instruments, and the composer played the concerto\\nin C sharp major. In the same year he made a contract with Artaria for\\nthe publication of his first three pianoforte trios. Two hundred and\\nforty-two copies were subscribed for, and the composer netted about $400,\\na respectable sum at that time, especially for the early works of a young\\nman.\\n\\nIn 1796 Beethoven went to Nuremberg, where he met his Bonn friends, the\\nBreuning brothers, and for some reason not clearly known, they were\\narrested at Linz by the police, but were quickly released. On his return\\nto Vienna he busied himself in overseeing the publication of sonatas\\n(Op. 2), minuets and variations. His brothers were in the city. Johann,\\n\"tall, black, handsome, a complete dandy,\" found a place in an apothecary\\nshop. Caspar, \"small, red-haired, ugly,\" gave music lessons. In February\\nBeethoven was in Prague and in Berlin, the only occasion on which he\\nvisited \"the Athens of the Spree.\" Frederick William II. was gracious to\\nhim, heard him play, and gave him a snuff-box filled with gold pieces;\\n\"not an ordinary box,\" as Beethoven proudly said when he showed it, \"but\\nsuch a one as they give to ambassadors.\" Beethoven also met Prince Louis\\nFerdinand and complimented him by saying, \"you play like an artist, not\\nlike a prince.\" He jeered at Himmel\\'s improvisation, and Himmel in turn\\npersuaded him that a lantern had been invented for the benefit of the\\nblind. He saw Fasch and Zelter. When he returned to Vienna the talk was of\\nNapoleon conquering in Italy.\\n\\nIn 1797 Beethoven, through imprudent exposure when he was heated,\\ncontracted a dangerous illness, and Zmeskall relates that it \"eventually\\nsettled in the organs of hearing.\" He worked at his trade. He entered\\ninto a contest with Wolfl, a virtuoso of remarkable technique, and they\\nvied with each other in friendly spirit; whereas in a similar and later\\ntrial of skill between Beethoven and Steibelt, the latter sulked at the\\npower of his rival. In 1798 he met Prince Rasumowsky, Count Browne,\\nRudolphe Kreutzer (who introduced him to Bernadotte, the suggestor of\\nthe \"Heroic\" symphony and the French ambassador), and in the following\\nyear he saw Dragonetti, the great player of the double-bass, who without\\ndoubt influenced him in his treatment of that instrument, and Cramer the\\npianist. The few recorded events of the next years are chiefly connected\\nwith music. The septet and first symphony were produced in 1800, and\\nApril 2 of the same year Beethoven gave the first concert in Vienna for\\nhis own benefit. He had left the palace of Prince Lichnowsky and lodged\\nat No. 241 \"im tiefen Graben.\" In the fall he went into the country, the\\nfirst instance of what was afterward his settled custom. We know of no\\npublication of music by Beethoven in 1800. He finished the first symphony,\\nthe septet (which he disliked), the string quartets Op. 18, the C-minor\\nconcerto Op. 37, the sonata Op. 22, and other works of less importance,\\nincluding the horn sonata for Punto. Czerny, ten years old, met him some\\ntime in this year, and he has left a curious description of him, although\\nit was written years after the meeting. He mentions the \"desert of a\\nroom--bare walls--paper and clothes scattered about--scarcely a chair\\nexcept the rickety one before the pianoforte. Beethoven was dressed in a\\ndark gray jacket and trousers of some long-haired material which reminded\\nme of the description of Robinson Crusoe. The jet-black hair stood upright\\non his head. A beard, unshaven for several days, made still darker his\\nnaturally swarthy face. He had in both ears cotton wool which seemed to\\nhave been dipped in some yellow fluid. His hands were covered with hair,\\nand the fingers were very broad, especially at the tips.\"\\n\\nIn 1801 he was feeling well and he worked hard. His ballet \"Prometheus\"\\nwas given March 28 with success. He changed his lodgings and dwelt in the\\nSailer-Staette, where he could look over the town-ramparts. When the days\\nlengthened, he went to Hetzendorf, near the shaded gardens of Schonbrunn,\\nmodelled after Versailles. \"I live only in my music,\" he wrote Wegeler,\\n\"and no sooner is one thing done than the next is begun; I often work at\\nthree and four things at once.\" \"The Mount of Olives\"; the violin sonatas\\nin A minor and F; the string quintet in C; the pianoforte sonatas, Op. 26,\\n27, 28, were completed in this year, and other works were sketched. The\\nso-called \"Moonlight Sonata\" brings before us Giuletta Guicciardi, to whom\\nit was dedicated, and the romance connected with her.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN LEADING THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF HIS QUARTETS.\\n\\nReproduced from a photograph of a painting in which the scene is\\nidealized.]\\n\\nThe noble women of Vienna were fond of Beethoven; to say they adored him\\nwould not be extravagant. They went to his lodgings or they received\\nhim at their palaces. Even his rudeness fascinated them; they forgave\\nhim if he roared angrily at a lesson, or tore the music in pieces; they\\nwere not offended if he used the snuffers as a tooth-pick. He, too, was\\nconstantly in love, but there is no reason to doubt that his attachments\\nwere honorable. \"Oh God! let me at last find her who is destined to be\\nmine, and who shall strengthen me in virtue,\" was his prayer. Yet Wegeler\\nsays, that he fancied himself a Lovelace and irresistible. He paraded his\\nattachments in dedications. There was the beautiful Hungarian Countess,\\nBabette de Keglevics; the Countess Therese of Brunswick; Baroness Ertmann,\\nthe Countess Erdody; and there were many others. In lesser station was\\nChristine Gherardi, and there was Madeleine Willman, the singer, who, it\\nis said, refused Beethoven\\'s hand because he was \"ugly and half-mad.\"\\nBut his passion for the woman Giuletta Guicciardi was deep-rooted, and\\nit deserves more than passing notice. Her family came originally from\\nthe Duchy of Modena, and in 1800 her father went to Vienna, an Imperial\\nCounsellor. She was in her seventeenth year, with dark blue eyes, waving\\nbrown hair, classic features, and a stately carriage. She was then as\\ngood as betrothed to Count Gallenberg, an impressario and a composer of\\nballets, whom she married in 1803. After Beethoven\\'s death letters of an\\nincoherent and a fiery nature were found in a secret drawer, and it was\\nsupposed that they were addressed to the Guicciardi until the ruthless\\nexamination of them by Thayer. She herself made light of the dedication\\nby telling Jahn in later years that Beethoven gave her the Rondo in G,\\nbut wishing to dedicate something to Princess Lichnowsky, he gave her the\\nsonata instead. Beethoven, when he was very deaf, wrote in bad French to\\nhis friend Schindler (for his conversation was necessarily at the time in\\nwriting) that he was loved by her; that he raised money for her husband;\\nand that when she returned to Vienna from Italy, she looked Beethoven\\nup and wept; but he despised her. The reader who wishes to investigate\\nthe subject and read of her strange adventures with Prince Hermann\\nPuckler-Muskau, even though illusions be thereby dispelled, is referred to\\nthe chapter \"Julia Guicciardi\" in \"Neue Musikalische Charakterbilder\" by\\nOtto Gumprecht (Leipsic, 1876).\\n\\nAnd in this year, 1801, the deafness, which began with violent noise in\\nhis ears, grew on him. In a letter to Wegeler, in which he speaks of a\\npension of about $240, from Lichnowsky, he tells of his infirmities. He\\nconnected the deafness with abdominal troubles, with \"frightful colic.\"\\nHe went from doctor to doctor. He tried oil of almonds and cold and warm\\nbaths. Pills and herbs and blisters were of little avail. He inquired into\\ngalvanic remedies. Zmeskall persuaded him to visit Father Weiss, monk and\\nquack. Discouraged, he still had the bravery to write, \"I will as far as\\npossible defy my fate, though there must be moments when I shall be the\\nmost miserable of God\\'s creatures... I will grapple with fate; it shall\\nnever drag me down.\" At the same time in telling his sorrow to Carl Amenda\\nhe swore him solemnly to secrecy.\\n\\nDr. Schmidt sent him in 1802 to Heiligenstadt, a lonely village, and there\\nhe wrote the famous letter known as \"Beethoven\\'s Will,\" addressed to his\\nbrothers, to be opened after his death (see page 331). It is possible\\nthat this letter full of gloom and distress was only the expression of\\nmomentary depression. The music of this same year is cheerful, if not\\nabsolutely joyous--the Symphony in D, for example--and on his return to\\nVienna he wrote letters of mad humor. He changed his lodgings to the\\nPeters-Platz, in the heart of the city, where he was between the bells\\nof two churches. He corrected publishers\\' proofs, and was \"hoarse with\\nstamping and swearing\" on account of the errors, \"swarming like fish in\\nthe sea.\" He quarreled with his brother Caspar, who interfered in his\\ndealings with publishers and brought to light compositions of boyhood.\\n\\nIn April, 1803, a concert was given, the program of which included \"The\\nMount of Olives,\" the Symphony in D, and the pianoforte concerto in C\\nminor, with the composer as pianist. The so-called \"Kreutzer Sonata\" for\\nviolin and pianoforte, written for the half-breed Bridgetower, was heard\\nthis year; there was a quarrel, and the now famous work was dedicated to\\nR. Kreutzer, who was in the train of Bernadotte. In the summer, Beethoven\\nwent to Baden near Vienna, and to Oberdobling, but before he left the\\ncity he talked with Schikaneder about an opera for the theatre \"_An der\\nWien_.\" He had also changed his lodgings again and moved to the said\\ntheatre with Caspar. The rest of the year, however, was chiefly given to\\nthe composition of the \"Heroic\" symphony, which was suggested to him in\\n1798 by Bernadotte. It is true that he went much in society, associating\\nwith painters and officials, and with the Abbe Vogler; he also began\\ncorrespondence with Thomson, the music publisher of Edinburg, concerning\\nsonatas on Scotch themes. At the beginning of 1804, he was obliged to seek\\nnew quarters, and he roomed with his old friend Stephen Breuning in the\\nRothe Haus. At first they had separate sets of rooms; they then thought\\nit would be cheaper to live together. Beethoven neglected to notify the\\nlandlord, and he was liable for the two suites. Hence hot words and a\\nrupture. The breach was afterwards healed, but Breuning, who apparently\\nbehaved admirably, wrote in a letter to Wegeler of Beethoven\\'s \"excitable\\ntemperament, his habit of distrusting his best friends, and his frequent\\nindecision. Rarely indeed, does his old true nature now allow itself to\\nbe seen.\" At Dobling he worked at the Waldstein Sonata and the Op. 54.\\nThe \"Bonaparte\" Symphony was finished, and, according to Lichnowsky, the\\ntitle-page bore simply the inscription \"Buonaparte,\" and the name \"Luigi\\nvan Beethoven.\" Beethoven had unbounded admiration for Napoleon as long as\\nhe was First Consul, and he compared him often with illustrious Romans,\\nbut when the Corsican made himself Emperor of the French, the composer\\nburst into violent reproaches and tore in pieces the title page of the\\nSymphony. When the work was published in 1806, the title announced the\\nfact that it was written \"to celebrate the memory of a great man\"; and\\nwhen Napoleon was at St. Helena, Beethoven once cried out, \"Did I not\\nforesee the catastrophe when I wrote the funeral march in the Symphony?\"\\nWhen he went back to Vienna for the winter, he lodged in a house of Baron\\nPasqualati on the Molker-Bastion; these rooms were kept for him, even when\\nhe occasionally moved for a season.\\n\\nIn 1805 Baron von Braun took Schikaneder as manager of the \"_An der\\nWien_,\" and they made Beethoven an offer for an opera. The story of\\nLeonora suited the composer, although Bouilly\\'s text had been already set\\nby Gaveaux and Paer; he worked diligently at his rooms in the theatre, and\\nlater in the fields of Hetzendorf. In the summer he went to Vienna to see\\nCherubini. In the fall the operatic rehearsal began. The singers and the\\norchestra rebelled at difficulties. The composer was vexed and angry. For\\nthe first time he welcomed deafness. He did not wish to hear his music\\n\"bungled.\" \"The whole business of the opera is the most distressing thing\\nin the world.\" The first performance was November 20th, 1805. Anna Milder,\\nto whom Haydn said, \"You have a voice like a house,\" was the heroine.\\nLouise Muller was _Marcelline_; Demmer, _Florestan_; Meyer, _Pizarro_;\\nWeinkopf, _Don Fernando_; Cache, _Jaquino_; Rothe, _Rocco_. The opera\\nwas then in three acts, and the overture seems to have been \"Leonora No.\\nII.\" The time was unfavorable. The French entered Vienna the 13th of\\nNovember; Napoleon was at Schonbrunn; nearly all of the wealthy and noble\\npatrons of Beethoven had fled the town. The opera was played three nights\\nand then withdrawn--a failure. It was revised, shortened, and with the\\noverture \"Leonora No. III.,\" it was again performed March 29, 1806, and\\nthe reception was warmer. It was played April 10th. Beethoven and Braun\\nquarreled, and Vienna did not hear \"Fidelio\" for seven or eight years.\\nParts of the pianoforte concerto in G and of the C-minor symphony, as well\\nas the two last of the Rasoumoffsky string quartets Op. 59 were composed\\nat this time.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nAfter a posthumous Medallion by Gatteux.]\\n\\nSome months in 1806 were passed in visits. Beethoven stopped at the\\ncountry-seat of Count Brunswick--and some say that he was in love with\\nTherese, the sister, to whom he dedicated his favorite sonata Op. 78, and\\nthat the posthumous love letters were addressed to her. He went to Silesia\\nto see Prince Lichnowsky. There were French officers there who wished to\\nhear him play, and when he refused, the Prince threatened in jest to lock\\nhim up. There was an angry scene, and Beethoven, rushing back to Vienna,\\ndashed a bust of the Prince to pieces. The 4th symphony was played at a\\nconcert in March, 1807, for Beethoven\\'s benefit. The subscriptions were\\nas liberal as the program, which was made up of two and a half hours of\\norchestral music. Clementi of London paid him $1,000 down for copyrights.\\nAnd so he had money and he was cheerful. He worked at the \"Coriolan\"\\noverture, and, it is believed, the Pastoral and C-minor symphonies. In\\nSeptember the mass in C was brought out under the protection of Prince\\nEsterhazy, who, accustomed to Haydn\\'s music, said to Beethoven, \"What,\\npray, have you been doing now?\" Hummel, the Chapelmaster, laughed, and\\nthere was no intercourse between the composers for some time. In spite of\\nthe failure of \"Fidelio,\" Beethoven looked toward the theatre and offered\\nto supply one grand opera and one operetta yearly at a salary of about\\n$960 with benefit performances, an offer that was rejected. 1807 saw the\\npublication of the \"Appassionata\" sonata and the thirty-two variations.\\nThe pianoforte concerto in G and the Choral Fantasia were performed in\\n1808.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nFrom a pencil drawing by Letronne, made in 1814. It has been engraved by\\nseveral artists. The above is reproduced from the frontispiece of the\\noriginal full score of \"Fidelio,\" published in Bonn.]\\n\\nThe pension from the Elector had been stopped. Prince Lichnowsky made\\nBeethoven a small allowance, and with this exception, the latter was\\ndependent on his own exertions. Some time in 1808 Jerome Bonaparte, King\\nof Westphalia, offered Beethoven the position of _Maitre de Chapelle_\\nat Cassel, with an annual salary, beside travelling expenses, of about\\n$1,500. This led the Archduke Rudolph, Prince Lobkowitz, and Prince Kinsky\\nto give a joint undertaking in March 1809 to secure Beethoven 4,000\\nflorins, payable half-yearly, a sum nominally worth about $2,000, and\\nreally about $1,000; this was lessened by the depreciation of the Austrian\\npaper and the bankruptcy and the death of Prince Kinsky. It was in this\\nyear that Beethoven met young Moscheles, began relations with Breitkopf\\nand Hartel, negotiated with Thomson about the harmonization of Scottish\\nmelodies, a contract which in the course of years netted him about $1,000.\\nThe French were again in Vienna. Wagram was fought. Beethoven, during\\nthe bombardment of his town, was in a cellar, and dreading the effect of\\nthe explosions on his hearing, called in the aid of cushions. Haydn died\\nin May, and there is no hint of the fact in the letters or journals of\\nhis quondam pupil. It was the year of the beginning of the \"Les Adieux\"\\nsonata, to commemorate the departure of the Archduke.\\n\\nMay, 1810, was the date of the first performance of the music to \"Egmont,\"\\nprobably in a private house, and in this month Beethoven first saw Bettine\\nBrentano, \"Goethe\\'s child, who seemed the incarnation or the original of\\nMignon.\" With her he fell in love, although she was betrothed to Count\\nArnim. The authenticity of the three letters which she published in after\\nyears as his has been a subject of warm dispute. It was in this same year\\nthat he contemplated marriage, and wrote for his baptismal certificate.\\nBut the name of the possible wife is unknown. Some have called her Therese\\nvon Brunswick; others Therese Malfatti.\\n\\nThere was a rumor in Vienna in 1811 that Beethoven thought of moving to\\nNaples in response to advantageous offers. His income was lowered by\\nthe depreciation in the value of the Austrian paper money. He suffered\\nfrom headaches, his feet were swollen, and he hoped that the climate\\nof Italy would bring relief. His physician did not favor the plan. In\\n1812 the Brentanos lent Beethoven about $920, and he tried the baths at\\nCarlsbad, Franzensbrunn, and Toplitz. At the latter place he fell in love\\nwith Amalie Sebald, a soprano from Berlin, about thirty years of age,\\nhandsome and intellectual. The affection was deep and mutual; why the\\nintimate relations did not lead to marriage, is an insoluble problem.\\nAnd here Beethoven met Goethe, whom he reverenced; but the poet saw in\\nhim \"an utterly untamed character.\" The acquaintance did not ripen into\\nfriendship, although Goethe recognized the \"marvellous talent\" of the\\ncomposer; Mendelssohn declared, however, in a letter to Zelter, that the\\nantipathy of the poet to Beethoven\\'s music was poorly disguised. Nor on\\nthe other hand did the composer relish the self-effacement of Goethe when\\nhe was in the presence of royalty. In October he visited his brother\\nJohann at Linz and found him entangled with a woman; he forced him to\\nmarry her by threats of arresting her and sending her to Vienna. 1812 was\\nthe year of the composition of the Seventh and Eight symphonies. Beethoven\\nreturned to Vienna in gloomy spirits; he was sick in body; he squabbled\\nwith his servants; Amalie Sebald was ever in his mind.\\n\\nThe defeat of the French at Vittoria in 1813 provoked the vulgar\\nprogram-music, \"Wellington\\'s Victory,\" which was suggested also by\\nMaelzel, the famous mechanician; it enjoyed great popularity, although\\nBeethoven himself regarded it as \"a stupid affair.\" Spohr was in Vienna\\nwhen Beethoven conducted an orchestral concert, the program of which\\nincluded the 7th symphony in MS. and this Battle Symphony. He and\\nMayseder, Salieri, Hummel, Moscheles, Romberg and Meyerbeer were in the\\norchestra. According to Spohr, Beethoven at this time had only one pair of\\nboots, and when they were repaired he was obliged to stay at home. In 1816\\nthe composer recorded in a note-book that he had seven pairs.\\n\\nIn 1814 Anton Schindler first met Beethoven. They grew intimate, and\\nfive years later he lived with him as a secretary. They quarreled, but\\nthey were reconciled shortly before the death of the composer. \"Fidelio\"\\nwas revived the same year. The new overture (in E) was included in the\\nperformance. Prince Lichnowsky died before the opera, which had undergone\\nalteration, was thus produced. Then came a quarrel between Beethoven and\\nMaelzel, which worried sorely the composer. September saw his triumph,\\nwhen six thousand people waxed enthusiastic at a concert given by him in\\nthe Redouten-Saal. There were royal and celebrated visitors, drawn to\\nVienna by the Congress. Beethoven wrote a cantata for the event. \"_Der\\nglorreiche Augenblick_\" (\"The Glorious Moment\"), a work unworthy of his\\nreputation. He was made an honorary member of the Academies of London,\\nParis, Stockholm and Amsterdam. Vienna gave him the freedom of the city.\\nHe was courted in the drawing-rooms of the great. The Empress Elizabeth of\\nRussia made him a present of about $4,600. He bought shares of the Bank of\\nAustria.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nFrom an engraving by Eichens after an oil painting by Schimon, painted in\\n1819.]\\n\\nCaspar Carl Beethoven died in November, 1815, and thus gave final and\\nposthumous anxiety to his brother Ludwig; for he left to him the care of\\nhis son Carl. The mother of the eight-year-old boy was not a fit person\\nto rear him, and Caspar had written his last wishes with an affectionate\\nreference to Ludwig, who in fact had ministered generously to his wants\\nand his caprices, and had thus spent at least $4,000. A codicil, however,\\nrestrained the uncle from taking his nephew away from the maternal house.\\nThe widow did not restrain her passions even in her grief, and Beethoven\\nappealed to the law to give him control of the boy. There were annoyances,\\nchanges of jurisdiction, and the decree was not given in his favor until\\n1820. It was before the _Landrechts_ court that Beethoven pointed to his\\nhead and his heart, saying, \"My nobility is here and here\"; for the cause\\nwas in this court on the assumption that the _van_ in his name was an\\nindication of nobility. Owing to these law-suits he composed but little;\\nstill it was the period of the great pianoforte sonatas Op. 106, Op. 109,\\nOp. 110. He was in straitened circumstances. In 1816 his pension was\\ndiminished to about $550. He had quarreled again with Stephen Breuning.\\nHe found pleasure in the thought that he was a father. He was influenced\\nmightily by the death of his brother and the painful incidents that\\nfollowed, not only in his daily life but in his work. At first there was\\na time of comparative unproductiveness, and the cantata \"Calm Sea and\\nHappy Voyage\" and the song-cyclus \"To the Absent Loved-one,\" with the\\npianoforte sonata Op. 101, are the most important compositions between\\n1815 and 1818. Texts for oratorios and operas were offered him, but he did\\nnot put them to music. In 1818 he received a grand pianoforte from the\\nBroadwoods, and there was vain talk of his going to England.\\n\\nHis friend and pupil, the Archduke Rudolph, was appointed Archbishop of\\nOlmutz in 1818, and Beethoven began in the autumn a grand Mass for the\\nInstallation. The ceremony was in March, 1820; the Mass was not finished\\nuntil 1822; it was published in 1827, and there were seven subscribers\\nat about $115 a copy; among them were the Emperor of Russia, the King of\\nPrussia, and the King of France. The summer and autumn of 1818 and \\'19\\nwere spent at Modling in the composition of the Mass, relieved only by\\nanxious thoughts about his nephew. Sketches for the 9th symphony date back\\nto 1817, and the theme of the scherzo is found in 1815. This colossal\\nwork was in his mind together with a tenth, which should be choral in\\nthe adagio and the finale, even when he wrote the overture in C for the\\nopening of the Josephstadt Theatre in Vienna and watched with fiery eyes\\nWilhelmine Schroder-Devrient, the Leonora of the revival in 1822. In this\\nsame year Rossini, sweeping all before him, visited Vienna, and tried\\nto call on Beethoven. According to Azevedo the interview was painful\\nbetween the young man flushed with success and the deaf and \"almost blind\"\\ncomposer of the Heroic Symphony. But Schindler affirms that Beethoven\\nsucceeded in escaping the visits. The operatic triumphs of Rossini and\\nthe thought of the Schroder-Devrient again led him to meditate opera.\\nThere were discussions concerning music to Goethe\\'s \"Faust,\" not in\\nset operatic form, but incidental airs, choruses, symphonic pieces and\\nmelodrama. In June, 1823, he was hard at work on the Ninth Symphony. He\\npassed whole days in the open air at Hetzendorf, but his host, a baron,\\nwas too obsequiously civil, and he moved to Baden, where in the fall he\\nreceived a visit from Weber. The Philharmonic Society of London in 1822\\npassed a resolution offering Beethoven ￡50 for a MS. symphony; the money\\nwas advanced, and the work was to be delivered in the March following.\\nRies was in London in the fall of 1823, and in September he heard from\\nBeethoven that the manuscript was finished, nevertheless there was\\nadditional work on it after the return to Vienna; and according to Wilder,\\nwho quotes Schindler, the finale was not written until Beethoven was in\\nhis new lodgings in town, and the use of the voices in Schiller\\'s Ode was\\nthen first definitely determined, although the intention was of earlier\\ndate.\\n\\nThe Italians still tickled the ears of the Viennese, who apparently cared\\nnot for German music, vocal or instrumental. Beethoven looked toward\\nBerlin as the city where his solemn Mass and Ninth Symphony (in spite\\nof his arrangement with the Philharmonic society of London) should be\\nproduced, and he negotiated with Count Bruhl. This drove finally the noble\\nfriends of Beethoven in Vienna to send him an address praying him to allow\\nthe first production of these new works to be in the city in which he\\nlived. Beethoven was moved deeply; he found the address \"noble and great.\"\\nThere were the unfortunate misunderstandings that accompany so often such\\nan occasion. Beethoven was suspicious, the manager of the Karnthnerthor\\ntheatre where the concert was given was greedy, and the music perplexed\\nthe singers and the players. Sontag and Ungher, who sang the female solo\\nparts, begged him to change certain passages, but he would not listen to\\nthem. The 7th of May, 1824, the theatre was crowded, with the exception of\\nthe Imperial box; no one of the Imperial family was present, no one sent\\na ducat to the composer. The program was as follows: Overture in C (Op.\\n124); the Kyrie, Credo, Agnus and Dona Nobis of the mass in D arranged in\\nthe form of three hymns and sung in German, on account of the interference\\nof the Censure, as the word \"mass\" could not appear on a theatre program;\\nthe Ninth Symphony. The public enthusiasm was extraordinary. As Beethoven\\ncould not hear the plaudits Caroline Ungher took him by the shoulders and\\nturned him about that he might see the waving of hats and the beating\\ntogether of hands. He bowed, and then the storm of applause was redoubled.\\nAfter the expenses of the concert there were about 400 florins for\\nBeethoven--about $200. The concert was repeated and the manager guaranteed\\n500 florins. The hall was half-empty. The composer was angry; he at first\\nrefused to accept the guarantee; and he accused his friends whom he had\\ninvited to eat with him of conspiring to cheat him.\\n\\n[Illustration: LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nFrom a lithographic reproduction of a painting made by Stieler, in April,\\n1820.]\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN\\'S STUDIO\\n\\nIn the Schwarz-Spanier house. From an engraving by G. Leybold of a drawing\\nmade three days after his death.]\\n\\nMeanwhile his nephew, for whom he was willing to make any sacrifice\\nand for whose benefit he labored incessantly and sold his manuscripts,\\nneglected his studies and became an expert at the game of billiards. On\\nthe return of Beethoven from Baden to Vienna in 1824, the nephew entered\\nthe University as a student of philology; he failed in a subsequent\\nexamination; he thought of trade; he failed in an examination for\\nadmission into the Polytechnic school; and although in despair he pulled\\nthe triggers of two pistols which he had applied to his head, he failed\\nto kill himself. He then fell into the hands of the police, was ordered\\nout of Vienna, and joined the Austrian army. After he was obliged to quit\\nVienna, the uncle and the nephew in 1826 lived with Johann at Gneixendorf.\\nThe surroundings were dreary; the stingy sister-in-law of Beethoven\\nrefused him a fire; the brother found that he must charge him for board\\nand lodging; and the nephew was insolent. He left the house in an open\\nchaise and caught a cold which settled in his abdomen. The result of the\\njourney was a sharp attack of inflammation of the lungs and dropsy. For\\nthe sake of his nephew Beethoven offered his manuscripts to publishers.\\nSchott bought the Mass in D for 1,000 florins and the Ninth Symphony for\\n600 florins. A young man named Holtz helped the composer in his business\\ncalculations and gained a strange influence over him; he even induced\\nhim to abandon occasionally his customary sobriety. And yet these days\\nof business and anxiety saw the composition of the last Quartets. Prince\\nNicholas de Galitzin of Saint Petersburg begged three string-quartets\\nwith dedications from him; he wrote to him in flattering terms; he named\\nhis bankers. Beethoven fixed the price at $115 a quartet. The Prince\\nacknowledged the receipt of two (E-flat Op. 127 and A minor Op. 132) and\\nregretted his delay in answering; \"I now live in the depths of Russia and\\nin a few days I shall go to Persia to fight.\" He promised again to send\\nthe money. Beethoven never received it, and the quartets were sold to\\npublishers. The third, B-flat Op. 130, originally ended with a long fugue\\nwhich was afterward published separately, and the new finale was written\\nat the dreary house of his brother, where he also finished the quartet in\\nF.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE \"SCHWARZ-SPANIER\" HOUSE, IN VIENNA, IN WHICH BEETHOVEN\\nDIED.\\n\\nFrom a photograph.]\\n\\nWhen he arrived at Vienna in December, 1826, he went immediately to bed\\nin his lodgings in the Schwarzspanierhaus. He had dismissed rudely two\\neminent physicians who had treated him for a former illness, and they\\nwould not now attend him. His nephew, who was charged with the errand of\\nfinding a doctor, played billiards and forgot the condition of his uncle,\\nso that two days went by without medical assistance. Finally Dr. Andreas\\nWawruch was told by a billiard-marker of the suffering of the sick man. He\\nwent to him and dosed him with decoctions. In a few days the patient was\\nworse, in spite of the great array of empty bottles of medicine. Dropsy\\ndeclared itself. He was tapped by Dr. Seibert, and during one of the\\noperations he said, \"I would rather see the water flow from my belly than\\nfrom my pen.\" Schindler and Breuning came to his bedside, and with them\\nyoung Gerhard Breuning, the son of Stephen. This lad now dwelled in the\\nhouse with Beethoven as his constant companion. Dr. Malfatti was persuaded\\nto forget his quarrels with the composer, and he consented to act in\\nconsultation with Dr. Wawruch. Beethoven saw his old friend gladly; but he\\nwould turn his back to Wawruch with the remark, \"Oh, the ass!\" Malfatti\\nadministered iced punch; for a short time the patient seemed stronger, and\\nhe talked of the 10th symphony. But in February, 1827, he was tapped for\\nthe fourth time; his aristocratic friends were forgetful of him, and even\\nthe Archduke Rudolph did not interest himself by cheap inquiry. In this\\nsame month Beethoven wrote to Moscheles and Sir George Smart telling them\\nof his strait, and begging them to arrange for a concert for his benefit.\\nAll this time he had the seven bank shares of one thousand florins each\\nthat were found with the two mysterious love letters in a secret drawer of\\nhis writing desk, the day after his death; these shares he held for his\\nscape-grace nephew, whom he made his sole heir, although by a codicil the\\ncapital was placed beyond his nephew\\'s control. The Philharmonic Society\\npromptly sent through Moscheles ￡100 on account of the future concert, and\\npromised more if it were necessary. Unable to compose, Beethoven tried to\\nread Sir Walter Scott\\'s \"Kenilworth,\" but he threw it aside and said, \"The\\nman writes only for money.\" He saw \"the divine fire\" in some of Schubert\\'s\\nsongs. He wrote many letters, he arranged certain dedications of his\\nworks, and he found pleasure in a lithograph of Haydn\\'s birthplace, and in\\na set of Handel\\'s compositions in forty volumes, which had been given him.\\nThe Rhine wine that he had asked of Schott came too late. Hummel called\\non him in March and introduced his pupil Ferdinand Hiller. On the 19th of\\nthis month Beethoven felt the end, and he said to Breuning and Schindler,\\n\"_Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est_.\" On the 23d he made with his\\nown hand the codicil above mentioned. Several people called, among them\\nSchubert, who saw him but could not speak with him. The last Sacraments\\nof the Roman Catholic church were administered to the dying man the 24th.\\nThen Beethoven wrestled with death until a quarter to six on the evening\\nof the 26th, when he gave up the ghost. His sufferings were atrocious; the\\nfinal agony was terrible. Just as he was delivered from his earthly ills a\\ntempest, a great storm of hail and snow, burst over the roofs of Vienna.\\nThere was a dazzling flash of lightning; and the roaring thunder roused\\nBeethoven. He pulled himself up in his bed, shook his fist at the sky, and\\nfell back dead. Anselm Huttenbrenner and the wife of Johann Beethoven were\\nby his side.\\n\\nThe post mortem examination was made by Doctors Wagner and Rokitansky.\\nWagner cut and preserved the temporal muscles and the organs of hearing.\\nThe body was dressed and exposed in the room of the death. The lower jaw\\nwas not sustained, and the face with its long hair and its beard of three\\nmonths\\' growth was savage.\\n\\nThe funeral was the 29th at three o\\'clock in the afternoon. It was\\nattended by an immense crowd. Dr. Breuning estimated the number of persons\\non the glacis and in the neighboring streets at 20,000. The coffin was\\nplaced on the shoulders of eight members of the Imperial Opera. Eybler,\\nHummel, Kreutzer, Weigl, Gyrowetz, Seyfried, Gansbacher and Wurfel held\\nthe streamers of the canopy. There were thirty-two torch bearers, whose\\nleft arms were wrapped in crape ornamented by lilies and white roses.\\nAmong these torch bearers were Czerny, Schubert and the giant Lablache. At\\nthe head, after the crucifix, four trombone players marched, and played\\nalternately with the singing of a choir of sixteen men the two Equali of\\nthe dead composer. The crowd that followed was so enormous that soldiers\\nwere summoned to force a way. The ceremonies were held at the Church of\\nthe Minorites, and the body was then put in a hearse which was drawn by\\nfour horses to the Wahringer cemetery. The gate was reached at the falling\\nof night, and the play-actor Anschutz delivered an address written by\\nGrillparzer. Other poems were read and distributed. Flowers and laurel\\nwreaths were heaped on the coffin when it was lowered to its resting place.\\n\\nThe 3d of April the furniture, clothes and the Graf and Broadwood\\npianofortes were sold at auction. The same day Mozart\\'s Requiem was sung\\nin the Hofpfarrkirche of the Augustines, and Lablache not only sang the\\nsolo bass but paid about $80 for the cost of the singers. In November the\\nmusical effects were sold at auction, and they brought about 1200 florins.\\nThe total amount of money then was about $5,000.\\n\\nIn 1863 the Gesellschaft der Musik-Freunde opened the tombs of Beethoven\\nand Schubert and reburied their bodies in leaden coffins. The 21st of\\nJune, 1888, the body of Beethoven was removed from the Wahringer cemetery\\nand transferred to the central cemetery of Vienna at Simmering. A monument\\nwas raised in Bonn in 1845, chiefly through the generosity and enthusiasm\\nof Liszt. It is by Hohnel, and it represents Beethoven standing, draped\\nin a mantle. A colossal statue by Zurnbusch stands in one of the public\\nplaces in Vienna, in front of the Academic Gymnasium.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN\\'S TOMB IN VIENNA CEMETERY.\\n\\nFrom a photograph.]\\n\\nWhen the body of Beethoven was exhumed in 1863 an impression and\\na photograph of his skull were taken. The head was remarkable. The\\nbox of bone was unusually thick; the dimensions of the forehead were\\nextraordinary; in height the forehead came next to that of Napoleon,\\nand in breadth it surpassed it. His face was strong and sombre, and\\nwhile it was not without ugliness, it was expressive. The head was built\\nstoutly throughout. The complexion was red and highly accented; though\\nSchindler tells us that it grew yellow in summer. The hair was thick and\\nrebellious; it was originally black, and in later years turned white.\\nHe shaved cheeks, chin and upper lip, and he was as awkward as Lord\\nMacaulay with a razor. The eyes were black, not large, and they shot forth\\na piercing flame when he was excited. The nose was thick; the jaw was\\nbroad; the mouth was firm, and with protruding lips; the teeth were white,\\nwell-shaped, and sound, and when he laughed he showed them freely; the\\nsquare chin rested on a white cravat. The greater number of pictures of\\nBeethoven are idealized. The most faithful likenesses are the miniature by\\nHornemann, taken in 1802, and sent by Beethoven to Breuning in token of\\nreconciliation; the drawing by Letronne, a French artist who was in Vienna\\nin 1814; and the portrait by Schimon in 1819. Two plaster masks were made;\\none by Klein in 1812; the other, a death-mask, by the sculptor Dannhauser,\\nfrom which Fortuny made an etching.\\n\\nBeethoven was below the middle height, not more than five feet five\\ninches; he was broad-shouldered, sturdy, with legs like columns. He had\\nhairy hands, short fingers, with square ends as though they had been\\nchopped. His movements were without grace but they were marked by their\\nquickness. He was awkward in holding playing cards; he dropped everything\\nthat he took in his hands. When he first went about in Vienna he dressed\\nin the fashion, with silken stockings, a peruke, long boots and a sword.\\nIn later years he wore a blue or dark green coat with copper buttons, a\\nwhite waistcoat and a white cravat; and he carried an eyeglass. His felt\\nhat was on the back of his head so that it touched his coat collar, as in\\nthe sketch of him by Lyser. His hat was often shabby and it excited the\\nattention of loungers as he amused himself by strolling aimlessly in the\\nstreets, and by peering into the shop windows. The skirts of the coat were\\nheavy laden; there would be within them an ear-trumpet, a carpenter\\'s\\npencil, a stitched-book for use in his written conversation, a thick\\nblank-book in quarto form, in which he jotted down vagrant thoughts and\\nmusical ideas. A pocket handkerchief would hang down to the calves of his\\nlegs, and the pockets bulged until they showed the lining. He would walk\\nin deep meditation; talk with himself; at times make extravagant gestures.\\n\\nHe was simple in certain ways, easily gulled; so absent-minded that he\\nonce forgot he was the owner of a horse. He could appreciate wit, although\\nhe preferred rough jokes and horse play. He enjoyed pranks at the expense\\nof others. He threw eggs at his cook and poured the contents of dishes\\nover the heads of waiters. He was often brutal and rude in his speech to\\nunoffending friends and strangers. The reproach of his being absurdly\\nsuspicious may be laid perhaps to his deafness. The son of a drunkard, he\\nwas on the whole abstemious; at the tavern he would sit apart with a glass\\nof beer and a long pipe, and there he would brood. Of restless nature, he\\nshifted constantly his lodgings, often with a whimsical excuse. He was\\nfond of washing himself. He ate greedily badly cooked food whenever it\\noccurred to him that he was hungry; and his digestion suffered thereby.\\nHe was fond of a panada with fresh eggs, macaroni sprinkled thickly with\\ncheese of Parma, and fish. His favorite drinks were cool and pure water,\\nand coffee which he prepared in a glass machine with extreme care, with\\nsixty beans in a cup. It is said that in later years his table manners\\nwere beyond endurance. When he tried housekeeping for the sake of his\\nnephew he was in continual trouble with his servants. He had little or no\\nsense of order.\\n\\n[Illustration: LIFE MASK OF BEETHOVEN\\n\\nTaken in 1812 by Franz Klein, Beethoven being then in his forty-second\\nyear. This mask and the bust made after it by the same artist (see page\\n341) are of the first importance in forming a correct judgment of the\\nvalue of all portraits of Beethoven.]\\n\\nBut the life of Beethoven, the man, was not merely a chronicle of\\nsmall-beer, a record of shifting of lodgings, quarrels, rude sayings and\\npersonal discomforts. His character was a strange compound of greatness\\nand triviality. The influence of heredity, the early unfortunate\\nsurroundings, the physical infirmity that was probably due to the sins\\nof his fathers, the natural impatience of a man whose head was in the\\nclouds with the petty cares of daily life:--all these unfitted him for\\nsocial intercourse with the gallant world in which he was, however, a\\nwelcomed guest. He was afraid of elegance or he disdained it. Frankness,\\nthat was often another name for brutality, was dear to him, and he saw no\\nwrong in calling men and women who talked when he played \"hogs.\" He was\\nproud, and his pride was offended easily. He was sure of his own work,\\nhe would therefore brook no contradiction; irritable, he was inclined\\nto quarrel. He preferred nature to man, and was never so happy as when\\nwalking and composing in the open. In fields and woods he meditated his\\ngreat compositions. Winter and summer he rose at the breaking of day and\\nbegan to write, but in heat or cold, rain or sunshine, he would rush out\\nsuddenly for air. Yet dear as light and air were to him, the twilight was\\nhis favorite hour for improvising.\\n\\n[Illustration: DEATH MASK OF BEETHOVEN\\n\\nTaken by Dannhauser, March 28, 1827, two days after Beethoven\\'s death.]\\n\\nHe used to read the Augsburg newspaper, and he was fond of talking of\\npolitics. It was a time of political unrest. Beethoven revered the heroes\\nof Plutarch; the leaders in the American revolution; Napoleon Bonaparte\\nas long as he was First Consul. A bronze statue of Brutus was on his\\nwork-table. It is not necessary, then, to add that he was a republican by\\nsentiment. He dreamed of a future when all men should be brothers, and the\\nfinale of the Ninth Symphony is the musical expression of the dream and\\nthe wish. We have seen his fondness for women. There is no proof however\\nthat he was ever under the spell of an unworthy passion. A wife was to\\nhim a sacred being; and in an age when unlimited gallantry was regarded\\nas an indispensable characteristic of a polished gentleman, Beethoven was\\npure in speech and in life. He was even prudish in his desire to find an\\nuntainted libretto for his music, and he could not understand how Mozart\\nwas willing to accept the text of \"Don Giovanni.\" He was born in the Roman\\nCatholic faith, and just before his death he took the Sacrament; but in\\nhis life he was rather a speculative deist. His prayer book was \"Thoughts\\non the works of God in Nature,\" by Sturm. It was difficult for him to\\nseparate God from Nature. Many passages in his letters show his sense of\\nreligious duty to man and God, and his trust and his humility. He copied\\nout and kept constantly on his work-table these lines found by Champollion\\nFigeac on an Egyptian temple:\\n\\n    I am that which is,\\n    I am all that is, that has been, and that shall be; no mortal\\n      hand has lifted my veil.\\n    He is by himself and it is to him that everything owes existence.\\n\\nAlthough his education had been neglected sadly in his youth, he was not\\nwithout literary culture. He could not write a legible hand;--indeed, he\\nhimself described his chirography as \"this cursed writing that I cannot\\nalter\"; his letters are often awkwardly expressed and incorrect; but they\\nalso abound in blunt directness, in personal revelation, and in a rude\\nand overpowering eloquence. In his reading he was first enthusiastic\\nover Klopstock; he soon wearied of the constant longing of that poet\\nfor death and abandoned him for Goethe. He was familiar with Schiller\\nand the German poets that were his own contemporaries. His literary\\nidols were Homer, Plutarch, and Shakespeare. He read the latter in the\\ntranslation by Eschenburg, which he preferred to that by Schlegel; this\\ntranslation was in his library, and it was thumbed by incessant reading.\\nSchindler says that Plato\\'s \"Republic\" was \"transfused into his flesh\\nand blood.\" He was an insatiable reader of histories. At the house of\\nMrs. Von Breuning in Bonn he was guided in a measure by the brother of\\nhis hostess. He knew Milton, Swift and other English writers in the\\ntranslations, and he was kindly disposed thereby toward England and\\nEnglishmen. It is not so easy to discover his opinions concerning music\\nfrom the few works found in his library, nor would it be wise to argue\\nfrom the chance collection. There was a volume of pieces taken from the\\ncompositions of Palestrina, Vittoria, Nanini and other Italians. He had\\nbut little of Sebastian Bach, who was then known chiefly as the author\\nof \"The Well-tempered Clavichord.\" He owned a portion of the score of\\n\"Don Giovanni\" and a few of Mozart\\'s pianoforte sonatas; he preferred,\\nhowever, the sonatas of Clementi, which he praised extravagantly. He\\nwas not ashamed to call himself the pupil of Salieri. He held Gyrowetz\\nand Weigl in sincere esteem. Prejudiced at first against Weber, who had\\nwritten violent critical articles against him, he changed his opinion\\nafter a more careful examination of \"Der Freischutz,\" in which he found\\n\"the claw of the devil\" side by side with \"singular things.\" \"I see what\\nhe intends, but in reading certain pages, such as the infernal chase, I\\ncannot help smiling. After all, the effect may be right; it is necessary\\nto hear it; but alas, I can no longer hear!\" He was undoubtedly jealous\\nof Rossini; \"Fortune gave him a pretty talent and the gift of inventing\\nagreeable melodies\"; but he thought him no better than a scene-painter\\nand accused him of a want of learning. Of all composers he appears to\\nhave most admired Handel dead and Cherubini, his contemporary. In a letter\\nthat was written by him to that great Italian-French composer, who is too\\nmuch neglected in these restless days, Beethoven assured him that he put\\nhis operas above all other works for the stage; that he took a more lively\\ninterest in one of his new compositions than in his own; that he honored\\nand loved him; that if it were not for his deafness, he would go to Paris\\nthat he might see him; and he begged him to consider him as worthy of\\nranking in the number of true artists. Of Handel he said, and shortly\\nbefore his death, \"This is the incomparable master, the master of masters.\\nGo to him, and learn how to produce, with few means, effects that are like\\na thunder-clap.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: PEN AND INK SKETCH OF BEETHOVEN\\n\\nAs he appeared on the streets of Vienna; drawn by J.P. Lyser, probably\\nabout 1820-25.]\\n\\n[Illustration: An ancient Egyptian inscription found in a temple at Sais,\\ndedicated to the Goddess Neith, which impressed Beethoven so much that he\\ncopied it, as above, and kept it framed under glass on his desk.]\\n\\nBut no collection of Beethoviana, no affidavits to the truth of anecdotes\\nand conversations, no photographic, no phonographic record of his daily\\nlife can give a just idea of the character of this extraordinary man. Its\\ngrandeur, titanic in its aspirations, is best seen or felt in the music\\nthat was to him the true organ of speech. To comprehend, to appreciate\\nBeethoven, the full knowledge of his compositions is necessary; and to the\\ntemperament of the composer must be added the corresponding temperament\\nof a fit hearer. The Beethoven that has voiced the longings, the joys and\\nthe sorrows of humanity was not merely the man who walked in the streets\\nof Vienna, not even the being to whom each tree sang the trisagion.\\nThe petty failings and the personal virtues of the individual assume\\nin his music gigantic, supernatural proportions. In his life passion,\\ntenderness, pride, arrogance, despair, tumultuous joy, fancy that was at\\ntimes grotesque, gayety that often was clowning were strangely mingled;\\njust as in \"King Lear\" the broken-hearted old man and the faithful fool\\ndefy together the raging of the elements. To the easy-going, amour-hunting\\ncitizen of Vienna Beethoven no doubt appeared, as to Rochlitz, \"a very\\nable man, reared on a desert island and suddenly brought fresh into the\\nworld,\" But to the faithful student of his life and works he seems one of\\nthe great high-priests of humanity. To the Beethoven of later years, shut\\noff from the world, lonely and full of sorrow, the conceiver of unearthly\\nmusic such as was never heard before, the sonorous hymn of the Opium Eater\\nover the mystery known among men as Shakespeare might well be chanted:\\n\\n\"O mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely\\ngreat works of art, but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the\\nsun and the sea, the stars and the flowers, like frost and snow, rain and\\ndew, hailstorm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission\\nof our own faculties, and in the perfect faith that in them there can be\\nno too much or too little, nothing useless or inert, but that, the farther\\nwe press in our discoveries, the more we shall see proofs of design and\\nself-supporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but\\naccident!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Signature: Philip Hale]\\n\\n\\nBEETHOVEN\\'S WILL.\\n\\n\"TO MY BROTHERS CARL AND ????. _To be read and acted upon after my death._\"\\n\\n\"TO MY BROTHERS CARL AND ???? BEETHOVEN:\\n\\n\"O ye who think or say that I am rancorous, obstinate or misanthropical,\\nwhat an injustice you do me! You little know the hidden cause of my\\nappearing so. From childhood my heart and mind have been devoted to\\nbenevolent feelings, and to thoughts of great deeds to be achieved in\\nthe future. But only remember that for six years I have been the victim\\nof a terrible calamity aggravated by incompetent doctors; led on from\\nyear to year by hopes of cure, and at last brought face to face with the\\nprospect of a lingering malady, the cure of which may last for years, or\\nmay be altogether impossible. Born with an ardent, lively temperament,\\nfond of social pleasures, I was early compelled to withdraw myself, and\\nlead a life of isolation from all men. At times when I made an effort to\\novercome the difficulty, oh how cruelly was I frustrated by the doubly\\npainful experience of my defective hearing! And yet it was impossible for\\nme to say to people, \\'Speak louder; shout, for I am deaf.\\' Ah, how was\\nit possible I could acknowledge weakness in the very sense which ought\\nto be more acute in my case than in that of others--a sense which at one\\ntime I possessed in a perfection to which few others in my profession\\nhave attained, or are likely to attain. Oh, this I can never do! Forgive\\nme, then, if you see me turn away when I would gladly mix with you.\\nDoubly painful is my misfortune, seeing that it is the cause of my being\\nmisunderstood. For me there can be no recreation in human intercourse,\\nno conversation, no exchange of thoughts with my fellow-men. In solitary\\nexile I am compelled to live. Whenever I approach strangers I am overcome\\nby a feverish dread of betraying my condition. Thus has it been with me\\nthroughout the past six months I have just passed in the country. The\\ninjunction of my intelligent physician, that I should spare my sense of\\nhearing as much as possible, well accorded with my actual state of mind;\\nalthough my longing for society has often tempted me into it. But how\\nhumbled have I felt when some one near me has heard the distant sounds of\\na flute, and I have heard _nothing_; when some one has heard a shepherd\\nsinging, and again I have heard _nothing!_ Such occurrences brought me\\nto the border of despair, and I came very near to putting an end to my\\nown life. Art alone restrained me! Ah! it seemed impossible for me to\\nquit this world forever before I had done all I felt I was destined to\\naccomplish. And so I clave to this distressful life; a life so truly\\nmiserable that any sudden change is capable of throwing me out of the\\nhappiest condition of mind into the worst. Patience! I must now choose her\\nfor my guide! This I have done. I hope to remain firm in my resolve, until\\nit shall please the relentless Fates to cut the thread of life. Perhaps I\\nshall get better; perhaps not. I am prepared. To have to turn philosopher\\nin my twenty-eighth year! It is no easy task--harder for the artist than\\nfor any one else. O God, Thou lookest down upon my inward soul; Thou\\nknowest, Thou seest that love for my fellow-men, and all kindly feelings\\nhave their abode there!\\n\\n\"O ye who may one day read this, remember that you did me an injustice;\\nand let the unhappy take heart when he finds one like himself who, in\\nspite of all natural impediments, has done all that was in his power to\\nsecure for himself a place in the ranks of worthy artists and men. My\\nbrothers, Carl and ????, as soon as I am dead request Dr. Schmidt in my\\nname, if he be still alive, to describe my disease, and to add to these\\npages the history of my ailments, in order that the world, so far at least\\nas is possible, may be reconciled to me after my death.\\n\\n\"Hereby I declare you both to be heirs of my little fortune (if it may\\nso be called). Divide it honestly; bear with and help one another. The\\ninjuries you have done me I have, as you know, long since forgiven. You,\\nbrother Carl, I thank specially for the attachment you have shown towards\\nme in these latter days. My wish is that your life may be more free from\\ncare than mine has been. Recommend Virtue to your children. She alone, not\\nmoney, can give happiness. I speak from experience. It was she alone who\\nraised me in the time of trouble; and I thank her, as well as my art, that\\nI did not seek to end my life by suicide. Farewell, and love one another.\\nI thank all friends, especially Prince Lichnowsky and Professor Schmidt.\\nThe instruments from Prince L???? I should like to be kept by one of you;\\nbut let there be no quarreling between you in regard to this. As soon as\\nyou can turn them to more useful purpose, sell them. How happy shall I be\\nif even when in my grave I can be useful to you!\\n\\n\"And thus it has happened. Joyfully I hasten to meet death. Should he come\\nbefore I have had the opportunity of developing the whole of my artistic\\ncapacity, he will have come too soon in spite of my hard fate, and I shall\\nwish he had come a little later. But even in that case I shall be content.\\nWill he not release me from a state of endless misery? Come when thou\\nwill\\'st! I go to meet thee with a brave heart. Farewell, and do not quite\\nforget me even in death! I have deserved this, since during my lifetime I\\nhave often thought of you, and tried to make you happy.

(See page 339.)]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DEAFNESS OF BEETHOVEN\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOne of the most painful of human spectacles is an intellect dominated by\\na physical ailment, a mind capable of the wise and useful exercise, of\\nits powers enthralled or checked in its peripheral expression by some\\nimperfection in the machinery in the midst of which it has its temporary\\nabiding-place.\\n\\nThe mental effects of bodily disease, in which the organs of special sense\\nare concerned, have been nowhere more carefully noted than in the cases\\nof those whose aptitude for some particular line of intellectual process\\nhas raised them above the average of their fellows, and the biographies of\\ncelebrated men seldom fail to record some instance of those ills to which\\nflesh is heir and to make deductions therefrom as to its influence upon\\nthe life-work of the individual.\\n\\nThere is no more pathetic picture than that of Beethoven in his later\\nyears, at an age when he should have been in the perfection of his\\nphysical manhood, deaf to overwhelming applause or striking in tumultuous\\ndiscord the piano which to him was dumb.\\n\\nReferences to this deafness, which was to Beethoven such a calamity, have\\nbeen carefully studied and recorded by his various biographers, and occur\\nnowhere more graphically than in those remarkable letters which give,\\nwithout the need even of reading between the lines, so clear an exposition\\nof the man as he was, as he aspired, and as he suffered. There has been as\\nyet however no attempt to collate this evidence with a view to making a\\nprecise diagnosis of his case or with reference to the possible influence\\nwhich the infirmity may have had upon his disposition, his habit of\\nthought or possibly even upon the character of his compositions.\\n\\n\"It is hard to arrive,\" says Grove, \"at any certain conclusion on the\\nnature and progress of Beethoven\\'s deafness owing to the vagueness of the\\ninformation; difficulty of hearing appears to have shown itself about 1798\\nin singing and buzzing in his ears, loss of power to distinguish words\\nthough he could hear the tones of voice, and great dislike to sudden loud\\nnoise; it was even then a subject of the greatest pain to his sensitive\\nnature; like Byron with his club-foot he lived in morbid dread of his\\ninfirmity being observed, a temper which often kept him silent, and when\\na few years later he found himself unable to hear the pipe of a peasant\\nplaying at a short distance in the open air, it threw him into the deepest\\nmelancholy, and he wrote the well-known letter to his brother in 1802,\\nwhich goes by the name of his Will.\" The above passage is really an\\nepitomization of Beethoven\\'s case, and, in connection with the collateral\\nevidence and viewed in the light of our present knowledge of aural\\ndisease, plainly sets forth the progress as well as the character of his\\ndisorder, the exciting cause of which must ever remain a question, though\\nthe inference from the course of his disease, from the report of the\\npost-mortem examination and from the evidence afforded by Dr. Bartolini,\\nis at least permissible, that Beethoven\\'s deafness originated, in part\\nat least, in a constitutional disorder which may have been one of his\\ninheritances from his father. Be that as it may, it is shown that he first\\nbecame definitely aware of his infirmity when he was twenty-eight years of\\nage, that his attention was first drawn to it and his appreciation of it\\nsubsequently heightened by the concomitant symptom of subjective noises\\nin the ears, rushing and roaring sounds which he designates as \"sausen\"\\nand \"brausen\"; this symptom, common to many forms of aural disease,\\noccurs in such cases as that of Beethoven\\'s only after the changes in\\nthe ear have already become well established, it marks a definite stage\\nin the progress of the malady and is explainable as follows: the normal\\ncirculation of blood through the blood-vessels is productive of sound,\\nprecisely as is the flow of water or other fluid through pipes; these\\nsounds vary in pitch and in intensity in proportion to the size of the\\nblood vessels and the rapidity of flow of the circulating fluid; in the\\nsmaller blood-vessels such as are found in the immediate vicinity of the\\nperceptive portion of the human ear the flow of the blood is continuous\\nand not rhythmic in response to the impulse from the heart as is the case\\nin the larger arteries; the sound resulting from the circulation in the\\nsmaller blood vessels of the ear is a high pitched singing ranging from\\na tone of about 15000 v.s. to one of 45000 v.s. while the sounds produced\\nby the larger vessels are very much lower in pitch; these sounds are\\npresent in normal conditions, but are not noticed because the adjustment\\nof the sound-transmitting portion of the human ear, the drum head, the\\nchain of small bones and the adjacent parts is such that sounds of this\\nclass, within certain limits of intensity, may be transmitted directly\\noutward and pass unnoticed; in the event, however, of structural changes\\nwhich interfere with the mobility of this sound-transmitting apparatus,\\nthe circulation sounds are retained within the ear and become appreciable.\\nThis does not occur however in chronic progressive cases such as was\\nBeethoven\\'s until the disease, insidious in its onset, is already well\\nadvanced, so that while the first mention of the impairment of hearing and\\nof the subjective noises is made in 1798, it is more than probable that\\nthe disease had been at that time several years in progress.\\n\\nTaking these facts in connection with the other symptoms already\\nmentioned, difficulty of distinguishing words and the dread of sudden\\nloud noises, a definite clinical picture is presented which taken in its\\nentirety permits the diagnosis of a chronic progressive thickening of the\\nmucous membrane lining the cavity of the middle ear and of the passages\\nleading therefrom to the throat.\\n\\nFor a better understanding of the case it is necessary to recall briefly\\nthe structure of that portion of the ear affected, namely, the drum\\nmembrane placed at the bottom of the outer canal of the ear to receive the\\nsound waves transmitted through that passage and in turn to transmit them\\nthrough the three small bones which form a chain of communication with the\\ninternal or perceptive portion of the ear; the drum membrane forming the\\nboundary between the outer passages and the middle ear, the latter cavity\\ncommunicating by means of the Eustachian tube with the upper part of the\\nthroat and being lined throughout with mucous membrane continuous with\\nthat in the latter cavity; in the middle ear this mucous membrane, very\\ndelicate and rich in blood vessels, not only lines the middle ear cavity\\nbut forms the inner coat of the drum-membrane and also covers the small\\nbones, their articulations and attachments, one of these latter being a\\nmuscle, the tensor tympani, which by its contraction renders all the\\nsound-transmitting apparatus more tense. It is easily appreciable that a\\ngradual thickening of this mucous membrane would result in a progressive\\nimpairment of the sound-transmitting apparatus, with a corresponding\\ndecrease in its power of transmitting sound waves not only from without\\ninward but from within outward. This interference would be first noticed\\nin the transmission of such short sound waves of slight impulse as occur\\nin instruments of high pitch or such as make up the qualitative overtones\\nof the human voice and it was therefore at a comparatively early period in\\nhis disease that Beethoven failed to hear the distant sound of the flute,\\nand of the shepherd singing, and to distinguish the difference in the more\\ndelicate modulations of the voices of his friends.\\n\\nThe distress induced by exposure to loud noises is also accounted for by\\nthe fact that the comparative rigidity of the sound transmitting apparatus\\ndeprived the deeper sensitive portion of the ear of the protection\\nnormally afforded it by the elastic structure capable of taking up\\nand dispersing the excessive impulse and by the further fact that the\\ncontraction of the tensor tympani muscle, which contraction is an almost\\ninvariable accompaniment of certain chronic diseases of the middle ear,\\nserved to still further impair the mobility of the drum-head and ossicles.\\n\\nLater and numerous references to his deafness scattered throughout his\\nletters and recorded by his friends and associates all point, with one\\nexception, to the steady, pitiless progress of a disease, at that time\\nunamenable to treatment, which finally totally deprived him of the sense\\nmost important to the musician; the one exception in question is that\\nrecorded by Charles Neate as heard from Beethoven\\'s own lips in 1815,\\nand is to the effect that in a fit of anger Beethoven threw himself upon\\nthe floor, and on arising found himself practically deaf in his right\\near. There was no explanation of this occurrence offered, but, taken\\nin connection with the report of the autopsy, it is apparent that the\\nsudden loss of hearing in the right ear was the result either of a form\\nof apoplexy of the labyrinth such as occurs in connection with the more\\nadvanced stages of chronic catarrh of the middle ear, or was due to a\\npeculiar affection of that portion of the internal ear devoted to sound\\nperception and consequent upon constitutional disease.\\n\\nSetting aside this incident, it may be noted that, while himself aware of\\nthe gradual increase of his deafness, it was not until eight years later,\\nin 1806, that it became especially appreciable to others, after which\\ntime its increase was so rapid that it could no longer be kept secret;\\nthe degree of the disability varying with his general condition, but\\nits progress being always downward, in 1815 it had so increased that he\\nabandoned his proposed visit to England, and before his death the hearing\\nhad become so much affected that his playing ceased to charm, he would\\nplay so loudly at times as to break the strings or drown soft passages of\\nthe right hand by striking the keys accidentally with the left, while the\\nhearing for his own voice even had become so imperfect that he spoke with\\nunnatural loudness and deficient modulation.\\n\\nThe influence of this almost life-long malady upon his disposition\\ncannot be estimated without taking into consideration the nervous strain\\nwhich the impairment of so important a sense would induce in a person\\nof Beethoven\\'s temperament; to the mental effects of apprehension of\\nfuture evil and the disappointments due to the futility of his efforts at\\nobtaining relief must be added the purely physical consequences of the\\nnatural attempt at compensation which results in what may be denominated\\nthe fatigue of deafness. Normally we possess double the amount of hearing\\nordinarily required for the uses of life, and it is possible therefore to\\nlose one half of the fullest amount of hearing without being appreciably\\naffected by the loss. Ordinarily, therefore, our hearing-power is\\nexercised without conscious exertion, but when this sense becomes impaired\\nto a certain degree, an effort at hearing is necessary because of the\\nloss of the sound of the more delicate qualitative overtones, such for\\ninstance as those which make the difference between the parts of speech\\nmost nearly resembling each other; to help out this deficiency the sight\\nis called upon to watch the motion of the lips, and still later by a\\nconscious effort those parts of a sentence which have been lost to hearing\\nand have failed of detection by sight are mentally filled in from the\\ncontext, three distinct brain processes being thus required to afford the\\ninformation which came before unconsciously of effort.\\n\\nThat such a nervous strain was part of the infliction which Beethoven\\nsuffered, is shown by his increasing disinclination for social intercourse\\nand a tendency to lead as he says a life of isolation from all men.\\n\"You cannot believe,\" writes his friend Stephan von Breuning, \"what an\\nindescribable impression the loss of hearing has made upon Beethoven;\\nimagine the effect on his excitable temperament of feeling that he is\\nunhappy, then comes reserve, mistrust often of his best friends, and\\ngeneral irresolution. Intercourse with him is a real exertion, as one can\\nnever throw off restraint.\"\\n\\nUndoubtedly his deafness, with the consequent isolation from his fellows,\\nhad the effect of increasing the morbid peculiarities which were his\\ninheritance, and of all his portraits extant there is none which so\\ndistinctly shows the face of the deaf man as that painted by his friend\\nMaler, Vienna, 1812.\\n\\n\"Beethoven\\'s deafness,\" says Goethe, \"has not hurt so much his musical as\\nhis social nature.\"\\n\\nIndeed it may be questioned if his musical nature were affected at all\\nother than favorably by his infirmity. His art was greater than the man,\\nor rather the man in his art was greater than himself; his deafness,\\neven by shutting him within, seems to have increased his individuality,\\nfor, from the time of its absolute establishment onward his compositions\\ngrew in musical and intellectual value, and each generation finds in\\nthem something new to study and to appreciate. He wrote not for his time\\nalone but for all time, and from what we can learn of his life and of the\\ninfluence of his infirmity upon his character, we are glad to believe that\\nthrough all the clouds which overcast his career Beethoven\\'s transcendent\\ngenius shone supreme, superior to circumstance, and that the world is left\\nnone the poorer, possibly the richer, because of the misfortunes which,\\nwhile they developed the peculiarities and intensified the faults of the\\nindividual, served but to enclose and protect the intellect too great to\\nbe bounded or controlled by the limitations of a saddened life.\\n\\n[Illustration: Clarence J. Blake]\\n\\n[Music: Fac-simile autograph musical manuscript written by Beethoven.\\nOpening measures of Pianoforte Sonata in A flat, Op. 26.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEETHOVEN AS COMPOSER.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe greatest of all instrumental composers began his career as a\\npianoforte virtuoso, and his earlier compositions are chiefly for that\\ninstrument. During the first years of Beethoven in Vienna, he was more\\nconspicuous as a virtuoso than as a composer, and it is said that Haydn\\nprophesied greater things of him as a performer than a creator of music.\\nThe older master could not foresee that Beethoven\\'s influence was destined\\nto live in his epoch-making concertos, trios and sonatas, rather than\\nin his wonderful piano playing. His superiority at Bonn as at Vienna\\nwas not so much in display of technical proficiency as in the power and\\noriginality of improvisation. When he was only eleven years of age Carl\\nLudwig Junker heard the boy play, and wrote in most enthusiastic terms of\\nthe inexhaustible wealth of his ideas; he also compared him with older\\nplayers of distinction and preferred Beethoven on account of his more\\nexpressive, passionate performance, that spoke directly to the heart. And\\nso Czerny described his improvisation as \"most brilliant and striking; in\\nwhatever company he might chance to be, he knew how to produce such an\\neffect upon every hearer, that frequently not an eye remained dry, and\\nlisteners would break out into loud sobs; for in addition to the beauty\\nand the originality of his ideas, and his spirited style of rendering\\nthem, there was something in his expression wonderfully impressive.\" Ries\\nand many others bear similar testimony. There were other pianists of great\\nparts who lived in Vienna or were heard there: Steibelt, Wolffl, and\\nespecially Hummel. But whenever Beethoven met them in friendly or fierce\\nrivalry, he conquered by richness of ideas, by variety of treatment and by\\nintense musical individuality, although he extemporized in regular \"form.\"\\nHummel excelled him undoubtedly in purity and elegance, and Wolffl had\\nextraordinary mechanism. They excited lively admiration, but Beethoven\\nmoved the hearts of his hearers. This power was greater than even his\\nfeats of transposing, his skill in reading scores, or such tricks as\\nturning the \\'cello part of a quintet upside down and then extemporizing\\nfrom the curious theme formed thereby. We are told that he was very\\nparticular as to the mode of holding the hands and placing the fingers,\\nin which he followed Emanuel Bach; his attitude at the pianoforte was\\nquiet and dignified, but as his deafness increased he bent more and\\nmore toward the keys. He was, when he played, first of all a composer,\\nand in his maturity, the \"composer\\'s touch,\" distinguished his playing.\\nCzerny said that he produced wonderful effects by the use of the _legato\\ncantabile_. He was, as a rule, persuaded easily to improvise--at least in\\nhis younger days--but he did not like to play his own compositions, and\\nonly yielded to an expressed wish when they were unpublished. It is also\\nsaid that he interpreted his own compositions with freedom, although he\\nobserved rigorously the beat. And he made often a profound impression in a\\n_crescendo_ by retarding the movement and not accelerating it.\\n\\nThe compositions of Beethoven have been divided by many writers into\\nthree periods, and this division has been followed with absurd precision\\nand has been as unjustly ridiculed. There were three periods, however,\\nbut they are not to be sharply defined; they correspond in general to\\nthe life-periods of youth, maturity, and old age. In his earlier works,\\nhe followed in some degree the path laid out by Haydn and Mozart; in\\nhis middle period, he appeared in the full strength and maturity of his\\nwonderful originality; finally, in his last period, he revealed himself as\\na prophet and dreamer of unearthly things. But it is not strange that the\\nstyle of a man of genius is modified by his age and his experience; that\\nhe thinks otherwise at forty than he thought at twenty; that his ideas are\\nnot rigid, immovable from youth to old age. In his earlier period, and in\\nthe first of his symphonies, he shows the influence of his predecessors,\\nand yet in his sixteenth work, three trios, known as Op. 1, striking\\noriginality and independence are asserted on every page.\\n\\nIt was his independence of character as much as his great musical gift\\nthat impelled him on the path of progress. He was five years old when at\\nConcord\\n\\n    ... \"the embattled farmers stood\\n    And fired the shot heard round the world.\"\\n\\nHe was the child of his time, and he lived to witness the great movement\\nfor freedom and humanity in America and Europe. Although he had warm\\nfriends and admirers among the nobility he would not bow down to rank and\\nwealth. The prince held no higher position in his estimation than the\\nprivate citizen. \"It is good to be with the aristocracy,\" he said; \"but\\none must be able to impress them.\" \"A trace of heroic freedom pervades\\nall his creations,\" says Ferdinand Hiller. The expression \"Im Freien,\"\\nwhich in German means both the open air and liberty, might serve as an\\ninscription of a temple devoted to his genius. It was this lofty spirit\\nthat impelled him to find new methods of musical expression in the older\\nforms of the symphony, sonata, string quartet, etc., which have the same\\ngeneral outlines of formal construction. These classical forms consist\\nof a cycle or group of three or four movements related to each other by\\ncontrast in tempo, rhythm, key, and æsthetic character. These movements\\nare combined so as to constitute an organic whole; complex and highly\\ndeveloped, like a great architectural building. Madame de Stael called\\narchitecture \"frozen music.\" This fanciful idea, so often quoted, suggests\\na different conception, perhaps as near the truth, that music may be\\nconsidered as a kind of rhythmical architecture. Such architectural music\\nappeals to the æsthetic sense of form and proportion through the ear by\\nthe stream of melody and harmony that flows in a rhythmical mass, whereas\\nthe \"frozen music\" appeals to us through the eye, which is able to take in\\nthe great outlines of proportion and form at once; so that the element of\\ntime is not considered. So far as form and construction are concerned, a\\nBeethoven symphony might well be compared with a Gothic cathedral in its\\ngrand outlines of beauty and strength, complexity, relation of the parts\\nto the whole, sense of proportion, and unity in variety. But in music, as\\nin all true art, form is but the means to an end: which is to move the\\nsoul through the æsthetic sense of beauty. This ideal structure of tones\\nwas not the invention of one musician; it was built up gradually, in the\\ncourse of a century and a half, by various composers until it reached its\\nculmination in the works of Beethoven. There are two distinct sources\\nfrom which cyclical instrumental music is derived. First, the sonatas\\nfor violins and bass which sprang up in the 17th century under Corelli,\\nBiber, Purcell and others. Subsequently the sonata was applied to the\\nsolo clavichord by Kuhnau, Sebastian and Emanuel Bach. Second, the Italian\\nopera overture, which came into vogue as separate instrumental music early\\nin the 18th century under the names of symphony and concerto. The Italian\\noverture consisted of three short, related movements--_allegro_, _adagio_,\\n_allegro_,--a slow movement between two fast ones. Sammartini, Emanuel\\nBach and a few others were the first to cultivate this three-movement\\nform: but it was not until the advent of Haydn that its modern character\\nwas acquired. Under his genius first came classical models. The sonatas\\nof Emanuel Bach were the starting point of Haydn\\'s music. He worked out\\ngradually the so-called art of free thematic treatment. Compared with\\nthe older style its chief features are greater freedom in developing the\\nthemes; the parts are not bound down to the rules of strict counterpoint;\\nthe melody is given chiefly to one voice, generally the upper. Free\\npassages are introduced between the several melodic groups that make up\\nthe contrasted themes. A general air of lightness, grace, elegance and\\npleasantness is the result of this freedom of treatment. A whole movement\\nis evolved out of little rhythmical motives or germs, which recur again\\nand again, under ever changing conditions of melody, harmony, key,\\nposition or range, and instrumentation. By such kaleidoscopic changes\\nthe motives express constantly new meaning and beauty without abandoning\\nthe central idea of the piece. Then, too, each movement is polythematic\\ninstead of monothematic. Haydn in these and other respects prepared the\\nway for Mozart and Beethoven, and neither of the three can be considered\\nwithout the other. Mozart and Beethoven obtained the structural form\\nand basis of instrumentation from Haydn; on the other hand, Haydn in\\nhis old age and Beethoven in his youth learned from Mozart a richer art\\nof instrumental color and expressiveness, especially in the use of wind\\ninstruments. While Mozart did not enlarge the cyclical forms beyond the\\ngeneral outlines laid down by Haydn, he beautified and enriched them in\\nall their details. In his last three symphonies and famous six quartets\\nthe beauty is more refined, the pathos more thrilling and profound, the\\ndissonances and modulations more daring and fascinating. His music is\\nconceived in a more serious vein.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN\\'S MONUMENT IN VIENNA.\\n\\nExecuted by Zumbusch. From a photograph. (See page 332.)]\\n\\nRubinstein, in his \"Conversation on music,\" has expressed admirably the\\nrelations between Beethoven and his time: \"Mankind thirsts for a storm;\\nit feels that it may become dry and parched in the eternal sunshine of\\nHaydn and Mozart; it wishes to express itself earnestly; it longs for\\naction; it becomes dramatic; the French revolution breaks out; Beethoven\\nappears.... The forms in his first period are the forms then reigning,\\nbut the line of thought is, even in the works of his youth, a wholly\\ndifferent one. The last movement in his first pianoforte sonata (F minor),\\nmore especially in the second theme, is already a new world of emotion,\\nexpression, pianoforte effect, and even pianoforte technique.... In the\\nworks of his first period altogether, we recognize only the formulas of\\nthe earlier composers; for, although the garb still remains the same for\\na time, we see even in these works, that natural hair will soon take the\\nplace of the powdered perruque and cue; that boots, instead of buckled\\nshoes, will change the gait of the man; that the coat, instead of the\\nbroad frock with the steel buttons, will give him another bearing. The\\nminuet is supplanted by the scherzo; the works are of a more virile\\nand earnest character:--through him instrumental music is capable of\\nexpressing the tragic, and dramatic humor rises to irony.... Smiling,\\nlaughing, merry-making, bitterness, in short, a world of psychological\\nexpression is heard in them. It emanates not from a human being, but as\\nfrom an invisible Titan, who now rejoices over humanity, now is offended;\\nwho laughs and again weeps, a supernatural being not to be measured!\"\\n\\nBeethoven\\'s music, more than any other before his time, is characterized\\nby vivid contrasts in the themes, passages, rhythmical effects, bold\\ndissonances and modulations, dynamic expression, varied and massive\\ninstrumentation. This is true, not only of the several movements as a\\nwhole, but of the subdivisions. The movements are held in close relation\\nby contrast of emotions, by elevated or depressed, passionate or calm\\nmoods. If the opening movement is conceived in a fiery or tragic spirit,\\nthe feelings after a time will be rendered all the more susceptible to the\\ncalm mood of the slow movement, which may lead through sadness and longing\\nto the vivacity and jocoseness of the _Scherzo_; and this in turn may\\ngive place to the triumphant joy of the finale. Each movement is employed\\nwith its special æsthetic problem and contributes its share to the total\\neffect of the work.\\n\\nFirst of all, Beethoven was destined to carry the art of free thematic\\nmusic to a point never before reached, never surpassed since his death.\\nThe several movements of his works are built on the broadest foundations,\\nthe musical periods are expanded to their utmost limits. The so-called\\nmiddle-part (mittelsatz) is more impressive and elaborate than with\\nhis predecessors. This is also the case with the coda, which is much\\nextended, worked-up, and made the climax of the whole movement. The\\nopening movements of the Heroic and the Fifth Symphonies are conspicuous\\nexamples. In the art of motive-building he followed Haydn and Mozart, with\\nnew results. The thematic play is of never-ending variety. The opening\\n_allegro_ of the Fifth Symphony is a wonderful instance of the development\\nof a great dramatic movement from a single motive of four notes. We learn\\nfrom his sketch-books the pains he took in the invention of his themes;\\nhow he turned them about, curtailed or amplified them. These themes\\nwhen chosen finally suffered endless metamorphoses. Yet through the\\nprotean changes of rhythm, melody, and harmony the theme preserves its\\nindividuality.\\n\\nIn composition he was extremely slow and fond of experimenting. We know\\nhis methods by his sketch-books which are preserved. Nearly every measure\\nwas re-written and re-written. The ideas at first were often trivial, but\\nthey were changed and elaborated until they grew to melodies of haunting\\nbeauty. Crude commonplaces became passages of mysterious grandeur. Many of\\nthe thoughts recorded hastily, in his room or in the fields, were never\\nused. The thought did not spring from his brain, as in the fable, fully\\nclothed: its birth was more akin to the Cæsarian operation. _Florestan\\'s_\\nair, for instance, had eighteen distinct and different beginnings, and the\\ngreat chorus in \"Fidelio\" had no less than ten. The blood would rush to\\nhis head as he worked; the muscles of his face would swell; and his eyes\\nwould almost start from their sockets; then, if he were in his room, he\\nwould strip himself of his clothing and pour water on his head.\\n\\nAmong the innovations made by Beethoven, may be mentioned the extension\\nof key relationship, which before him was not recognized. He broke down\\nthe restrictions that governed transitions. Here he was revolutionary. The\\nprinciples of his harmonic combinations have been thus formalized by Mr.\\nDannreuther: \"(_a_) Any chord can succeed immediately any chord belonging\\nto another tonality, no matter how remote, provided they have one note\\nin common, even if it be only harmonically so. (_b_) It is possible to\\nproduce quick harmonic progressions into the most remote tonalities by\\nmeans of chromatic and enharmonic changes in individual parts, which\\nare made to move on step by step, thus building a sort of chromatic or\\nenharmonic bridge.\" And Mr. Dannreuther cites as instances, the connection\\nbetween variations 32 and 33 in Op. 120; and the return from B major, at\\nthe close of the \"working out,\" to the first subject in B-flat major in\\nthe first movement of Op. 106. Before the time of Beethoven composers of\\nsonatas and symphonies had generally confined themselves to a narrow range\\nof keys. The theme of the first movement was given out in the tonic, and\\nif it was major, it was answered by the second theme in the fifth above;\\nthat is to say, if the sonata were in C, the second subject would be in\\nG. If the movement were in the minor, the second subject would be in the\\nrelative major: i.e. the second theme of a movement in C minor would be\\nin E flat. So too the key of the second movement was usually restricted,\\nalthough sometimes there was a little more liberty. The painstaking\\nGrove has examined the eighty-one works of Beethoven in sonata form. The\\ntransition to the dominant occurs only three times; to the subdominant\\nnineteen times; to the third below thirty times. \"His favorite change was\\nevidently to the submediant or third below--that is to say, to a key less\\nclosely related to the tonic and more remote than the dominant key.\" He\\nmakes it as early as Op. 1, No. 2.\\n\\n[Illustration: BUST OF BEETHOVEN.\\n\\nMade by Franz Klein, after the Life-mask taken by him in 1812. (See page\\n327.)]\\n\\nWagner once compared the conventional connecting passages between the\\nmelodic groups of Haydn and Mozart to \"the rattling of dishes at a royal\\nfeast.\" Beethoven could not tolerate the traditional commonplaces, which\\nwere often mere padding. In these intermediate periods he used phrases\\nwhich hinted at or were actually closely related to the main themes, and\\nhe thus gave the movement the effect of an organic whole, the development\\nof which was as logical as the results that follow from a law of nature.\\nOr he would surprise the hearer by the introduction of a fresh episode of\\nlength and importance, although by it the formal rules of the theorist\\nwere defied. Even in his second period there are remarkable instances\\nof absolute originality in form as well as in style and conception,\\nas the opening adagio of the pianoforte sonata in C-sharp minor, or\\nthe _Con moto_ of the pianoforte Concerto in G. Nor was his manner of\\nthe introduction of the themes themselves after the manner of his\\npredecessors; \"the glory of the phrase often appeared as it were through\\nclouds that first shrouded it and were then dispelled.\"\\n\\nHe was the greatest master of the art of varying a theme, and his genius\\nennobled even pianoforte variations, which are too apt, as made by others,\\nto show mere skill and learning, or excite by superficial brilliancy\\nthe vain display of the virtuoso who plays simply that he may dazzle.\\nIn this species of art is seen the wealth of his ideas as well as the\\nconsummate mastery in expression. In the second and the third period of\\nhis style there are shining examples of his power in this direction. One\\nkind of variation is peculiarly his own, in which everything is changed,\\nthe rhythm, the melody and the harmony, and yet the theme is clearly\\nrecognized. Then there are great variations without the name, as the slow\\nmovements in the sonata \"appassionata\" and the Trio in B-flat; the slow\\nmovements of the C minor and Ninth Symphonies; the finale of the Heroic.\\n\\nEhlert has spoken of the inexorable logic of Beethoven\\'s music, the\\nimpossibility of rearranging the order of thought, of adding or taking\\naway. In other words, the concentration of his musical thought is never\\ntoo bold, his speech is never too laconic; nor is he tautological or\\ndiffuse. The intensely emotional and dramatic characteristics of his music\\nimpelled him to invent a great variety of dynamic changes, or rhythmical\\nsyncopations. When we compare him in this respect with his predecessors,\\nwe are struck by the great number of marks of expression. The care with\\nwhich he indicated the _nuances_ is seen in all his works, but he paid\\nmore and more attention to the matter as he neared the end of his career.\\nThe Cavatina in the Quartet in B-flat, for instance, is sixty-six measures\\nlong, and there are fifty-eight marks of expression. He wished by all\\npossible means to produce what he himself called, in reference to the\\nHeroic Symphony, \"the special and intended effect.\" Furthermore certain of\\nthe indications reflect his personality, as the famous directions in the\\nMass in D, and the \"_beklemmt_\" in the Cavatina before mentioned.\\n\\nIt has been said that the criterion wherewith to judge of all music\\nwhatsoever is this: \"Technical exposition being considered equal, the\\nquality and the power of the emotional matter set forth should turn the\\nscale between any two pieces of music.\" Now Beethoven not only invented\\na new technical language; he invented the necessity of a race of players\\nthat should speak it. The pianist that interprets properly a composition\\nof Beethoven must clothe his mechanism with intellectuality and virile,\\npoetic spirit. It was held by Jacob Grimm that no definite thought can\\nexist without words, and that in giving up the words instrumental music\\nhas become an abstraction, as all thought has been left behind. It seems,\\nhowever, an error to limit thought or consciousness to words. There is a\\nstate of consciousness, without verbal thinking, in which we realize great\\nmoments of existence; and this state of consciousness has its clear and\\npowerful language. Such a spiritual language is music, and its greatest\\npoet is Beethoven. Even those works of Beethoven which have no title to\\nindicate the practical plan of the author are expressions of particular\\nemotions and conceptions that cannot be explained in words, yet convey a\\ndistinct impression to the consciousness of the hearer.\\n\\nNot that he was the originator or the abettor of that which is now known\\nas program music; for program music, whether the epithet be applied solely\\nto that music which without words aims to portray or suggest to the hearer\\ncertain definite objects or events, or whether it be applied loosely to\\nall characteristic or imitative music, is not a thing of modern invention.\\nIn a sacred ballet of the Greeks, which represented the fight of Apollo\\nwith the Python, the action was accompanied appropriately by flutes,\\nlutes, and trumpets, and the grinding of the teeth of the wounded monster\\nwas imitated by the trumpet. In the part-songs of Jannequin and his\\ncontemporaries, battles, birds and hens were imitated in music. Buxtehude\\ndescribed in double counterpoint, \"the peaceable and joyous ending of\\nSimeon after the death of his son.\" The first movement of Dittersdorf\\'s\\norchestral symphony \"Actaeon\" portrayed the chase; Diana took her bath in\\nthe second; in the minuet Actaeon played the part of \"Peeping Tom\"; and\\nin the finale he is torn in pieces by the hounds for his indiscretion.\\nTo prove that there is nothing new under the sun, a wise man of his day,\\nnamed Hermes, wrote analytical programs of the fifteen symphonies of\\nDittersdorf for the benefit of the hearer and for his own glory. But why\\nmultiply such instances familiar to the searchers after the curious in\\nmusic?\\n\\nBeethoven gave certain compositions a general name, as the pianoforte\\nsonata Op. 81 _a_, known as \"Das Lebewohl\" (or \"Les Adieux\"); the overture\\nto \"Egmont\"; the Pastoral Symphony. But these names were not supplied with\\na detailed program of words that the music might be identified properly\\nand the right emotion recognized or subdivided. When he prefixed the\\nfollowing words to the Pastoral Symphony, \"more expression of emotions\\nthan tone-painting,\" he at the same time made his confession of faith.\\nNevertheless the commentators, the successors of Hermes above mentioned,\\nhave seen in this same symphony a good citizen going with his family to\\nspend Sunday in the country, or a pantheistic hymn of subtle nature; just\\nas in the Seventh Symphony Wagner finds the apotheosis of the dance,\\nanother the joy of Germany delivered from the French yoke, while others\\nsee a festival in the days of chivalry, the reproduction of a brave\\nmeridional people, a village marriage, a procession in the catacombs, the\\nlove dream of a sensuous odalisque, a Bacchic feast, a battle of giants,\\nor a vulgar orgy to serve as a temperance lecture. \"But in the kingdom of\\nhypothesis each one has a right to think freely, and even, alas, to speak\\nhis mind.\"\\n\\nIf a striking characteristic of the music of Beethoven is its\\nindividuality with accompanying infinite variety--as seen in the\\nsymphonies, the concertos, nearly all of the pianoforte sonatas, and\\nthe chamber music--a no less striking feature is its intense dramatic\\nspirit. The reproach has been made against Beethoven that his genius\\nwas not dramatic, but surely reference was here made to the scenic\\nconventionalities of opera. But if the dramatic in music lies in the\\ndevelopment of passion, Beethoven was one of the greatest dramatic\\ncomposers. To quote Henri Lavoix in his remarks on the Fifth Symphony: \"Is\\nthis not the drama in its purity and its quintessence, where passion is no\\nlonger the particular attribute of a theatrical mask, but the expression\\nof our own peculiar feeling?\"\\n\\nAn important factor in the full expression of this dramatic intensity\\nin his orchestral writing is the instrumentation. All the instruments\\nare used with greater freedom and effect than ever before. In order to\\nexpress his great musical ideas the instruments move in a wider compass\\nwith greater technical execution. In instrumental coloring, in variety of\\nsolo and chorus treatment, and in massive rhythmical effects, Beethoven\\nadvanced the art of orchestration to a point never before conceived,\\nHis effects, however, are not gained by the introduction of unusual\\ninstruments. With the exception of the Ninth Symphony and a few other\\ninstances, his orchestra is practically the one used by Mozart. In the\\nNinth Symphony, as in \"the Battle of Vittoria,\" there is a liberal use\\nof percussion instruments. Beethoven used the contra fagott and the\\nbasset horn on occasions; and he once indulged himself in the singular\\nfancy of arranging his \"Battle of Vittoria\" for Maelzel\\'s instrument,\\nthe Panharmonikon, a machine that brought in play all sorts of military\\ninstruments. But the instrumentation of his symphonies does not depend for\\nits effects on unusual combinations; it is remarkable for the manner of\\nthe speech of well-known members of the orchestra. Take the strings for\\nexample. He knew full well the value of the _pizzicato_, and _tremolo_ as\\nwell as the power of the unison. Outside of the famous chamber music, the\\nsymphonies are filled with passages for the \\'cello and double bass that\\nare unusual for his time. In his treatment of the double bass, which in\\nthe C-minor Symphony was a stumbling block to Habeneck and his trained\\nmen, he was influenced by the skill of Dragonetti. In his use of the\\nwood-wind he showed rare instinct and imagination. The oboe, for instance,\\nis with him not a gay rustic pipe of acid character; it is positive, it is\\nmelancholy, it is tender and it soothes. In the famous solos of the first\\nmovement of the Fifth Symphony and the dungeon scene of Fidelio, the oboe\\nutters heart-piercing accents of sorrow. What is more characteristic than\\nthe odd cluckings of the bassoons in the scherzo of the Fifth Symphony;\\nthe soulful clarinet solo in the allegretto of the Seventh, or the weird\\neffect of the low notes of the horn in the _trio_ of the scherzo of the\\nSeventh Symphony? Beethoven held the trombones in great reserve, but\\nwhenever he employed them the effect was impressive, as for instance in\\nthe _finale_ of the Fifth Symphony and the storm of the Pastoral Symphony.\\nTwo famous passages in his symphonies, passages that have provoked angry\\ndisputes, are made remarkable by a singular use of the horn in which the\\nlaws of tonality are set at nought. Beethoven was the first that knew\\nthe value of the kettle-drums. He first raised the drum to the dignity\\nof a solo instrument, as in the Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. His\\ninstrumental effects went hand in hand with the development of the\\nmelodic idea. The different tone-masses are used in conversation; or a\\nsolo instrument announces the return of the theme; or the whole orchestra\\nrages violently and then stops suddenly to listen to a far off voice.\\n\\nIt would be impossible in an article of this brevity to speak of his\\nmanifold effects of instrumentation, or of the characteristics of his\\ncompositions in detail. Among his instrumental works are the 9 symphonies,\\noverture and music to \"Egmont,\" overture and music to \"Prometheus,\"\\n\"The Battle of Vittoria,\" 9 overtures, 5 concertos for pianoforte and\\norchestra, 1 triple concerto, the Choral Fantasia, the violin concerto, 16\\nquartets for strings, 8 trios for pianoforte and strings, 10 sonatas for\\npianoforte and violin, 2 octets for wind, 1 septet for strings and wind,\\n1 quintet for pianoforte and wind, 5 sonatas for pianoforte and \\'cello,\\n38 sonatas for pianoforte, and 21 sets of variations for pianoforte. The\\nchief vocal works are \"Fidelio,\" the two masses, the oratorio, \"Christus\\nam Oelberge,\" \"Meerstille und gluckliche Fahrt,\" the aria \"Ah perfido!\"\\nand 66 songs with pianoforte accompaniment.\\n\\nWe have already considered briefly the various ways in which Beethoven\\nexpanded the structural elements of the sonata, and now it may not be\\namiss to examine for a moment the æsthetical characteristics of his\\npianoforte works in sonata form. In the early sonatas he began with the\\nfour movements which others had almost wholly reserved for the symphony.\\nThe scherzo in sonata and symphony was peculiarly his invention. To be\\nsure the name is older, and was used in describing secular songs in the\\n16th century as well as for instrumental pieces in the 17th. But the\\npeculiar quickly moving number with its piquant harmonies and rhythm and\\nits mocking, grotesque or fantastically capricious spirit is the musical\\nthought of Beethoven. At times the scherzo assumed gigantic proportions\\nas in the Third, Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, and in the sonata Op. 106.\\nBefore his day the imagination of the composer had not had full play; it\\nwas more or less hampered by conventionalities, by the necessities of\\nthe men dependent on princes\\' favors. The expansion of a great idea in\\nthe sonata is found first in his works. Deep feeling, passionate longing\\ntook the place in the slow movement of simple melody with its unmeaning\\nand elaborate ornamentation. He introduced the recitative with thrilling\\neffect. Although the breadth of the thought in different movements is\\nmajestic even to awe, all phases of human feeling are expressed. Strength\\nand delicacy, gloom and playfulness are found side by side. The sonata\\nform with Beethoven was the means of the full development of all the\\nexpressive elements in music.\\n\\nThese considerations are likewise true of his piano and violin sonatas,\\ntrios and concertos, the most prominent of which are the so-called\\nKreutzer Sonata, for piano and violin, trio in B flat, violin concerto,\\nand piano concertos in G and E flat. These famous works stand foremost\\nin their respective branches, but to dwell on their individual\\ncharacteristics would exceed the limits of this article.\\n\\nIn contrast with the later symphonies, the First and Second seem without\\nthe rare personality of the composer. Yet when the First Symphony appeared\\nits opening was regarded as daring; and there is the seriousness of\\npurpose that is found in all of his greater compositions. In the Second\\nthe introduction is built on broader foundations; there is a warmth in\\nthe slow movement that was unusual for the time, and the scherzo is new\\nin character. But in the Heroic, Beethoven laid the cornerstone of modern\\nsymphonic music. It was written with a definite aim; the glorification of\\na great man. The instrumentation is noticeable in a historical sense on\\naccount of the treatment of the orchestra as a whole; the balance of the\\nparts, the conversations, the antiphonal choirs. The Funeral March is the\\ndeparture from the traditional slow movement that was generally devoted\\nto prettiness or the display of genteel emotion. And in this symphony\\nthe scherzo is Shakesperian in spirit where melancholy or grimness is\\nmingled with the jesting. It has been said that the last movement of the\\nHaydn Symphony was designed to send the audience home in gay spirits; but\\nwith Beethoven the finale became the crown of the work. The finale of\\nthe Heroic is not as impressive as are the preceding movements; but it\\nabounds in interesting detail, and was in its day a remarkable revelation.\\nThe Fourth is built on a lesser scale, and yet as Berlioz well said, the\\nadagio defies analysis, \"the movement that seems to have been sighed by\\nthe Archangel Michael when, a prey to melancholy, he contemplated from\\nthe threshold of heaven the worlds below him.\" In the Fifth Beethoven rid\\nhimself completely of the shackles of conventionality. It is the story\\nin music of the composer\\'s defiance of Fate, the battling of man with\\nnature and unseen forces. Here trombones and contra fagott appeared for\\nthe first time in the history of the symphony. The Sixth is full of peace\\nand serenity and joy in life that comes from the contemplation of Nature,\\nand stands in strong contrast with the sublime struggle and exulting\\ntriumph of the Fifth. The Seventh is perhaps the most truly romantic\\nand sensuously beautiful of all. Joy and sorrow, humor and wild passion\\nalternate in its strongly contrasted movements. This great work, together\\nwith the three string quartets, Op. 59, are held by some musicians to be\\nthe highest manifestation of subjective feeling and ideal beauty that\\nmusical art has yet revealed. In conciseness of form the Eighth is almost\\na return to earlier conditions, but in concentrated power and joyousness\\nit is one of the most remarkable and Beethovenish. He himself described\\nit as a \"little symphony in F.\" The substitution of the Ariel-like and\\nhumorous _allegretto_ in place of the slow movement, and the use of the\\n_menuetto_ are eminently characteristic. The Choral Symphony stands\\nalone in the history of music. It is said that the first three movements\\n\"have reference, more or less intelligible according to the organization\\nand sympathies of the hearer, to the _finale_,\" which is a setting of\\nSchiller\\'s \"Ode to Joy,\" or rather \"Liberty,\" which was the original title\\nof the poem. Here all \"the dramatic and human elements which Beethoven\\nintroduced into his instrumental music to a degree before undreamed\\nof\" are brought together in complete expression. Moreover in the Ninth\\nSymphony as in his great Mass in D there dwells the profound spirit of\\nreligious consciousness. The burden of the hymn heard above the symphonic\\nstruggle of the orchestra is joy, love and brotherhood for all mankind,\\nor that charity which is the true essence of the Christian religion. Like\\nDante\\'s Divine Comedy or Bach\\'s Passion Music, the Ninth Symphony will\\nlive as one of the greatest monuments of genius.\\n\\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN\\'S MONUMENT IN BONN.\\n\\nExecuted by Prof. Hahnel. Unveiled in August, 1845. From a photograph made\\nin 1880.]\\n\\nThe human voice was to Beethoven an orchestral instrument, and he too\\noften treated it as such. This failing is seen particularly in the Mass\\nin D, \"Fidelio,\" and the Ninth Symphony. Yet he showed in the song-cycle,\\n\"To the Absent Loved-one,\" a knowledge of the art of Italian song and the\\nprinciples of _bel canto_ that accompanied German taste and sentiment, as\\nalso in his most famous song \"Adelaide.\" In his great choral works and\\nin his opera he showed himself everywhere as the instrumental writer _par\\nexcellence_. \"Fidelio\" is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The text has been\\npraised highly, but probably more on account of its noble subject than\\ndramatic treatment; for the interest stops with the great dungeon-scene.\\nAs a drama it has the defects of operas in general of his time. Spoken\\ndialogue and separate solo and concerted numbers naturally prevent\\ndramatic unity and consistency of effect.\\n\\nUndoubtedly the orchestra is the chief figure of the opera, dominating\\nconstantly the scene. This, however, is as true of Wagner as of Beethoven.\\n\"There is not an instrumental note that has not its passionate, dramatic\\nmeaning; there is not an instrument that is not a party to the drama.\"\\nWith the exception of the prisoners\\' chorus, the most impressive\\npassages of \"Fidelio\" are those in which the orchestra is openly master:\\nthe overture No. III., the melodramas, the introduction to the air of\\n_Florestan_. The overture No. III. is the whole story of the agony and\\nthe womanly devotion of Leonore in concise and tragic form; just as the\\novertures to \"Egmont\" and \"Coriolanus\" are the summing up of the tragedies\\nof Goethe and Collin, although \"Coriolanus\" is undoubtedly derived\\ndirectly from Plutarch and Shakespeare. The force and the meaning of the\\naccompaniment is always in proportion with the degree of passion on the\\nstage. When _Pizarro_ meditates his vengeance and the orchestra mimics the\\nstorm within his breast, it matters little that the voice of the singer\\nis drowned. And so the air of the delirious _Florestan_ is less thrilling\\nthan the preceding prelude; and the oboe tells of his agony although he\\nhimself cries it to the dungeon walls.\\n\\nThere is little or no doubt that when Beethoven wrote his Ninth Symphony,\\nhe thought of Schiller\\'s original conception, the ode to Freedom, and not\\nthe altered and present version, the ode to Joy. To Beethoven, freedom\\nwas the only joy; to him the universal freedom of loving humanity was\\ntrue religion: the brotherhood of man. That the singers rebelled against\\nthe frightful difficulties of their task was nothing to him; he heard the\\nvoices of a triumphant world, and he was not to be confined by individual\\nlimitations. So in his mass in D, he thought not of the service of the\\nRoman Catholic church: he arrayed the human against the supernatural.\\nIt is not church music so much as the direct, subjective expression of a\\nreligious heart, which cannot be restrained by the barriers of mere form\\nand ritual. Some have argued seriously that because Beethoven was not\\npunctilious in the observance of the rites of the Church he was therefore\\nunfitted to celebrate in music her solemn service. Now whatever his\\nreligious opinions were, whether he was deist or pantheist, there is no\\ndoubt that he appreciated fully the dignity of his task and consecrated\\nall his energies to the performance of it. He meditated it most carefully,\\nas we know by his sketch-books. In 1818 he wrote a memorandum: \"To compose\\ntrue religious music, it is necessary to consult the olden chorals in use\\nin monasteries\"; and he added below: \"Make once more the sacrifice of\\nall the petty necessities of life for the glory of thy art. God before\\nall!\" In the manuscript is written over the _Kyrie_, \"From the heart! May\\nit go back to the heart!\" and over the _Dona Nobis, \"Dona nobis pacem_.\\nRepresenting the inner and exterior peace.\"\\n\\nIt is idle to compare this Mass with the religious works of Palestrina\\nand Bach and to say that if Beethoven had been a devout Catholic or an\\northodox Lutheran his Mass would have been more thoroughly imbued with\\nreligious feeling. In the first place it is necessary to define the word\\n\"religious.\" Palestrina wrote in his peculiar style not because he was a\\ndevout Catholic, but because his religious individuality found expression\\nin the methods of his time. Bach wrote his great Mass in a time when\\ncounterpoint ruled in the music of the church and of the dance. Beethoven\\nwas a man, not only of his time, but of the remaining years of this\\ncentury.\\n\\nNow in this mass Beethoven wherever he is most imposing, he is intensely\\ndramatic, and when he follows tradition, he is least himself. Notice for\\ninstance the change from the passionate entreaty that is almost a defiance\\nin the _Kyrie_ to the ineffable tenderness in the _Christe eleison_; the\\nwonderful setting of the _Incarnatus_ and the _Crucifixus_. On the other\\nhand, where Beethoven felt that it was his duty to follow the approved\\nformulas, as in certain passages of the _Credo_ that relate to the\\ncommunion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, etc., we realize fully the\\nstory of Schindler, who found the composer singing, shouting, stamping,\\nand sweating at his work; for although he was a master of the _fugato_,\\nthe fugue was to him, apparently, not his natural mode of expression.\\nBut von Bulow\\'s commentary should not be forgotten: \"The fugue is with\\nBeethoven the last and highest means of intensifying the expression of\\nemotions.\"\\n\\nAgain, the religious element in the music of Beethoven is not confined\\nto works which have a sacred text. The yearning after heavenly rest,\\nthe discontent with the petty vanities of life, sublime hope and humble\\nthanksgiving,--these are not found exclusively in his works for the church\\nor in such a movement as the _canzona in moda lidico_ in the A minor\\nquartet Op. 132. The finale of the Ninth Symphony as well as movements in\\nthe sonatas, the chamber-music and the symphonies are religious music in\\nthe profoundest sense of the word.\\n\\nAnd yet the great works of his last years have been decried and are\\nnot now accepted by many. He himself was discontented with many of his\\nearlier compositions, and this self-depreciation does not seem the\\nsingular yet not uncommon affectation of genius. In a letter written to\\nRies in 1816 he declared that the death of his brother had impressed him\\nprofoundly and influenced not only his character but his works. For a\\ntime following he wrote but little; and then he pondered compositions\\nof gigantic proportions. The pianoforte ceased to accommodate itself to\\nhis thoughts; the string quartet and the orchestra were constantly in\\nhis mind. \"The most exalted, the most wondrous, the most inconceivable\\nmusic,\" says Rubinstein, \"was not written until after his total deafness.\\nAs the seer may be imagined blind, that is, blind to his surroundings,\\nand seeing with the eyes of the soul, so the hearer may be imagined\\ndeaf to all his surroundings and hearing with the hearing of the soul.\"\\nDeafness befriended him when it closed the doors of sense. It helped him\\nto turn from outward things, and find peace and consolation in the ideal\\nworld of tones. The spiritual voices that he heard were the companions\\nof his solitude. He thus vindicated the true spirituality of music. The\\ndeaf man justified its ancient, poetical significance. This inward life\\naccounts for his early inclination for instrumental music. The highly\\ndeveloped forms gave wide range to his imagination, through the almost\\nunlimited resources of the orchestra, in compass, technical execution, and\\ntone-color.\\n\\nWhile in his orchestral works Beethoven reveals all the tragic fire, and\\ndramatic strength of his nature, it is in his string quartets that he is\\nmost spiritual and mystical. This is due, first, to the nature of the\\nfour combined instruments, so pure and ethereal in their tone effects.\\n\\nHis friend Schuppanzigh, the violinist, complained to him that certain\\npassages in one of his quartets were impossible; and Beethoven replied:\\n\"Do you believe that I think of a wretched violin, when the spirit speaks\\nto me and I write it down?\" The last five quartets have been called\\ntranscendental, even incomprehensible, on account of their strangeness and\\nobscurity. They are his last utterances, the mystical creations of a man\\nwho neared the end of his life-tragedy. \"The events in Beethoven\\'s life,\"\\nsays Nohl, \"were calculated more and more to liberate him heart and soul\\nfrom this world, and the whole composition of the quartets appears like a\\npreparation for the moment when the mind, released from existence here,\\nfeels united with a higher being. But it is not a longing for death that\\nhere finds expression. It is the heartfelt, certain, and joyful feeling\\nof something really eternal and holy, that speaks to us in the language\\nof a new dispensation. And even the pictures of this world, here to be\\ndiscerned, be they serious or gay, have this transfigured light, this\\noutlook into eternity.\" Spirituality is impressed on the eternal features\\nof the music: that is, the technical treatment of the four instruments.\\nThe melodies move freely in a wide compass, the voices cross each other\\nfrequently. Widely extended, open harmony is often employed, giving\\nwonderful etherealness and spirituality to the effect of the strings\\nby their thinness and delicacy of tone when thus separated by long\\nintervals between the several parts of the chords. Nor is the polyphonic\\nmelodiousness of the voices abandoned, as in certain quartets of later\\nmasters in which the treatment is more orchestral than is in keeping with\\nthe character of the solo instruments.\\n\\nAnd yet these great quartets are not even now accepted by certain men\\nof marked musical temperament and discriminating taste. They are called\\n\"charcoal sketches\"; they are erroneously regarded as draughts for\\nelaboration in orchestral form. Others shrug their shoulders and speak\\ncompassionately of the deafness of Beethoven. But he was deaf when, in\\ndirecting the Seventh Symphony, he was obliged to follow the movements of\\nthe first violin that he might keep his place; he was deaf when he thought\\nout the melodic freshness and elegance of the Eighth Symphony; and even\\nbefore the Heroic, the Fifth and the Pastoral he mourned his physical\\ninfirmity in the celebrated letter to his brothers. In judging of the\\nmasterpieces of the so-called third period it is not necessary to join the\\ncry of the critics like Fetis who complain of \"the aberrations of a genius\\nthat goes out in darkness,\" or to swell the chorus of wild enthusiasts\\nas Nohl and Lenz, who wrench the dictionary in the expression of their\\ndelight. In the light of these great works all criticism is blind and\\nimpotent.\\n\\nIn the cyclical forms of instrumental music, Beethoven is preeminent from\\nall points of view, formally, technically, aesthetically, and spiritually.\\nMoreover, there is a Shakesperian quality in his wonderful tone-poems.\\nLike the great poet he touches every chord of the heart and appeals to\\nthe imagination more potently than other poets. Beethoven\\'s creations,\\nlike Shakespeare\\'s, are distinguished by great diversity of character;\\neach is a type by itself. His great symphonies stand in as strong contrast\\nwith each other as do the plays of Shakespeare with each other. Beethoven\\nis the least of a mannerist of all composers. \"Each composition leaves\\na separate image and impression on the mind.\" His compositions are\\ngenuine poems, that tell their meaning to the true listener clearly and\\nunmistakably in the language of tones, a language which, however, cannot\\nbe translated into mere words, as has often been attempted in the flowery\\nand fanciful effusions of various writers, like Wagner, Lenz, Marx, and\\nothers, who waste labor and thought in trying to do the impossible.\\n\\nIn the Pantheon of art Beethoven holds a foremost place beside the great\\npoets and artists of all time, with Æschylus and Dante, Michael Angelo\\nand Shakespeare. Like these inspired men he has widened and ennobled\\nthe mind and the soul of humanity. \"In his last works,\" says Edward\\nDannreuther, \"he passes beyond the horizon of a mere singer and poet, and\\ntouches upon the domain of the seer and prophet, where in unison with all\\ngenuine mystics and ethical teachers he delivers a message of religious\\nlove and resignation, and release from the world.\" Or as Wagner wrote,\\n\"Our civilization might receive a new soul from the spirit of Beethoven\\'s\\nmusic, and a renovation of religion which might permeate it through and\\nthrough.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Signature: John K.

The house in which Schubert was born is now Number 54\\nin the Nussdorfer Strasse, and the fact is recorded upon a marble tablet\\nover the door. His immediate ancestry were peasants. His father and\\nuncle came from Moravia to Vienna, and were schoolmasters there for many\\nyears. His mother, Elizabeth Fitz, before her marriage, was in domestic\\nservice as a cook. After her death in 1812 the elder Schubert married Anna\\nKlayenbok. By his first marriage he had fourteen children, of whom Franz\\nwas the thirteenth; by the second marriage there were five children, two\\nof whom were living about 1880. The step-mother was an excellent mother\\nto Franz. Two of his elder brothers, Ignaz and Ferdinand, lived and died\\nas schoolmasters, like their father. It seems to have been an admirable\\nfamily; its members, so far as we know, were noted for conscientious\\nindustry and integrity, and were affectionately devoted to one another.\\nIt is clear that there was a love for music in the family, though we have\\nfew details on this point. Ignaz and Ferdinand were taught the violin by\\ntheir father. The little Franz began of himself to pick out melodic themes\\non an old piano much the worse for wear, and thought it a rare treat when\\na friendly joiner\\'s apprentice used now and then to take him to a piano\\nshop, where he was allowed to try his infant hands upon new and fine\\ninstruments. At the age of seven he began to study the violin with his\\nfather, and the piano with his brother Ignaz, then aged nineteen; but in\\na very short time he had got quite beyond these teachers, and was sent to\\nthe parish choir-master, Michael Holzer, for instruction in violin, piano,\\norgan, and thorough-bass, as well as in singing. But the astounded Holzer\\nsoon found, as he said long afterward, \"whenever I wished to teach him\\nanything fresh, he always knew it already.\" Holzer was fond of giving him\\nthemes on which to extemporize, and used to exclaim with rapture that the\\nlittle fellow \"had harmony at his fingers\\' ends.\"\\n\\nInstances of precocity among musicians of genius are by no means rare. But\\nfor precocity of the highest order, as well as for spontaneous exuberance\\nof musical originality, Schubert has probably been equalled by none save\\nMozart. The world is familiar with the stories of Mozart found by his\\nfather in the act of scrawling a piano concerto at four years of age, and\\nof his composing a symphony for full orchestra at eight. A piano sonata\\nin D major for four hands, which he wrote in his ninth year, is still\\nvery commonly played, and is astonishing for its maturity of thought\\nand its complete mastery of the sonata form. There is no evidence of\\nthe beginning of such work on Schubert\\'s part at such an early age. His\\nfantasia for four hands was written when he was thirteen years old, and\\nhis first recorded song, \"Hagar\\'s Lament,\" in the following year; but\\nthere is reason for believing that he had before that time composed songs,\\npieces for piano, and string quartettes. Before completing his eleventh\\nyear he had come to be leading soprano singer and violin player in the\\nchoir at the parish church of Lichtenthal, in Vienna. The next year he\\nobtained a situation as chorister in the Emperor\\'s Chapel, and became a\\npupil in the Imperial school known as the \"Convict,\" a name derived not\\nfrom _convincere_, but from _convivere_, and implying that the members\\nor \"convictors\" were \"messmates.\" It was but scant conviviality that\\nwas allowed by the ignorant parsimony with which that somewhat famous\\ninstitution was managed. Those poor growing boys, with the wolfish\\nappetites belonging to their time of life, had but two wretched meals\\ndaily and more than eight hours apart, while in the winter season their\\nbenumbed fingers shrank from contact with the ice-like key-boards. How\\noften some promising lad may have succumbed to such a regimen, while\\nhis death was piously ascribed to Providence, we are not informed. That\\nthe effect upon Schubert\\'s constitution was deleterious may readily be\\nbelieved. In one of the earliest of his letters that have been preserved,\\ndated November 24, 1812, we find him beseeching his brother for a few\\nkreutzers wherewith to get now and then a roll or some apples to keep off\\nstarvation during the long exercises in the freezing schoolroom.\\n\\nIn the _Convict_ more or less instruction was given in history and\\nmathematics, French and Italian, drawing and writing. In such branches\\nas he studied, Schubert seems to have done fairly well, but as he went\\non the tendency grew upon him to neglect everything else for the sake\\nof music. Instrumental music was elaborately studied, and symphonies\\nand overtures of Haydn, Mozart, and others were diligently practised\\nby an orchestra of boys, in which Schubert distinguished himself from\\nthe first. Soon after his arrival in the school, the conductor of this\\norchestra--a big boy, named Joseph von Spaun, afterward Baron and Member\\nof the Imperial Council, and well known as an amateur musician--remarked\\nhow finely \"the little fellow in spectacles\" played; from which we may\\ninfer that Schubert\\'s near-sightedness dated from his childhood. After\\na while the little fellow himself became first violin and often served\\nas conductor. A warm friendship grew up between Schubert and Spaun, who\\npresently discovered that the shy boy of twelve was already possessed by\\nan unappeasable rage for composition. His head was brimming over with\\nmelodious thoughts, with which he would cover every scrap of music paper\\nthat he could get hold of. But either the _Convict_ was niggardly in\\nits supply of writing materials no less than of food and fuel, or else\\nthe needs of the new-comer were such as had never before been heard of;\\nfor he could not get enough paper on which to jot down the daily flow\\nof musical ideas, nor was his scanty stock of copper coins sufficient\\nto procure sheets enough to meet his wants. Having made this discovery,\\nthe kindly Spaun determined that his little friend should no longer\\nsuffer from this kind of privation; and from that time forth Schubert\\'s\\nconsumption of music paper was astonishing. In April, 1810, he wrote the\\nfour-hand fantasia for piano, probably the earliest of his compositions\\nthat is still preserved. It fills thirty-two closely written pages, and\\ncontains a dozen movements, each ending in a different key from that in\\nwhich the piece begins. \"Hagar\\'s Lament,\" written in March, 1811, is\\nthe earliest of his songs still preserved. Perhaps it ought rather to\\nbe called a nondescript vocal piece, or an attempt at a song-cycle; it\\ncomprises twelve numbers, with singular and sometimes irrelevant changes\\nof key, and covers twenty-eight pages. In spite of its fragmentary and\\ninorganic character, it bears the unmistakable stamp of genius. From the\\noutset, whatever his faults, Schubert was always free from the fault of\\nwhich Schiller complains that it fetters so many of us poor mortals: he\\nwas never guilty of being commonplace. Whatever came from him was sure to\\nbe something that no one else would have thought of, and it was sure to\\nbe rich in beauty. In view of this, the spontaneity of his creativeness\\nwas almost incredible, and fully justifies the comparison with Mozart.\\nThis same year saw the production of two other vocal pieces, a second\\npiano fantasia, a string quartet, and a quintet-overture,--to mention\\nonly those that have survived. Doubtless many writings of that early time\\nwere neglected and lost. Schubert seldom showed much interest in a work\\nof his own after it was finished, for his attention was absorbed in fresh\\ncomposition. But he had a methodical habit of dating his works and signing\\nthem \"Frz. Schubert, _mpia_,\" i.e. _manu propria_; and this habit has\\nbeen helpful to his biographers in studying the progress of his artistic\\nlabors. The list for 1812 is remarkable for this half-starved boy of\\nfifteen, containing as it does an overture for full orchestra, two string\\nquartets, and a sonata for piano, violin, and viola, besides other works\\nfor piano and strings.\\n\\nBut the list for 1813 begins to seem portentous. Here comes the first\\nsymphony (in D; four movements), an octet for wind instruments, three\\nstring quartets, a third piano fantasia, thirty-four minuets, a cantata\\nfor his father\\'s birthday, and about thirty other vocal pieces, including\\ncanons, terzets, and songs for a single voice. Besides all this he began\\nto set to music Kotzebue\\'s opera \"Des Teufels Lustschloss,\" which he\\ncompleted in the following year. In looking over the vocal pieces, one\\nobserves an almost unbroken succession of about a dozen with words by\\nSchiller; and this illustrates one of Schubert\\'s ways of doing things.\\nWhen he happened to turn over the leaves of a volume of poetry, verses\\nthat pleased him would become straightway clothed in melody; they would\\nsing themselves in his mind, often in all their concrete fullness, with\\nsuperb accompaniments, noble in rhythm and rich in wondrous harmonies.\\nIf paper happened to be within reach the song would at once be written\\ndown, and the inspired youth would turn to some other poem, with like\\nresults. What in the ordinary reader fond of poetry is simply an emotional\\nreaction of keen indescribable pleasure was in his case a sudden thrill\\nof musical creation. Thus we are told that on a July evening in 1826,\\nafter a long walk, the thirsty Schubert strolled into a beer-garden and\\nfound a friend sitting at one of the tables with a volume of Shakespeare.\\nAfter he had laid down the book Schubert picked it up and alighted upon\\nthe song in Cymbeline, \"Hark, hark, the lark!\" The beautiful melody with\\nits accompaniment, as we now have it, instantly flashed upon him and was\\nwritten down upon some staves hastily drawn across the back of a bill\\nof fare. In like manner, in the course of the same evening, he set to\\nmusic the drinking song in Antony and Cleopatra, and clothed with fresh\\nimmortality the verses \"Who is Sylvia\" in the Two Gentlemen of Verona. In\\nits matchless perfection the Sylvia song would of itself suffice for a\\ncomposer\\'s reputation. In such wise would Schubert often look through a\\nbook, and come from its hasty perusal with a dozen or more new songs.\\n\\n[Illustration: SCHUBERT\\'S BIRTHPLACE IN VIENNA.--From a photograph.]\\n\\nIt is in this astonishing spontaneity that Schubert\\'s greatness largely\\nconsists. In some elements of artistic perfection he is lacking, and\\nthe want may be traced to some of the circumstances of his education.\\nHis early teachers were simply overwhelmed by his genius and let him go\\nunguided. Holzer, as we have seen, whenever he wished to teach the boy\\nanything, found that the boy could teach him. So Ruzicka, instructor\\nin thorough-bass at the _Convict_, simply protested that Schubert must\\nhave learned music directly from heaven, and he could do nothing for\\nhim. Sir George Grove very properly asks, \"If all masters adopted this\\nattitude toward their pupils, what would have become of some of the\\ngreatest geniuses?\" Schubert certainly suffered from defective knowledge\\nof counterpoint; after coming to maturity he recognized this defect\\nin his education and sought to remedy it by study. Herein he was at a\\ndisadvantage compared with his younger contemporary Mendelssohn. Himself\\na musician of extraordinary precocity and spontaneity, Mendelssohn became\\nthoroughly grounded in counterpoint under one of the best of teachers,\\nZelter; and in all his works Mendelssohn shows that absolute mastery of\\nform, the lack of which is often noticeable in Schubert, especially in\\nhis instrumental works. Upon this point we shall have occasion to make\\nsome further comment. There can be little doubt that the worthy Ruzicka\\nwould have done well had he given his wonderful pupil a careful training\\nin counterpoint. The heaven-sent music would have lost nothing of its\\nheavenly quality by enlarging its means of expression.\\n\\nAbout the first of November, 1813, Schubert left the _Convict_ and studied\\nfor awhile in the Normal School of St. Anna, in order to qualify himself\\nfor a school-teacher. He escaped conscription by entering his father\\'s\\nparish school, where he served three years as teacher and discharged the\\nmonotonous and irksome duties of that position with scrupulous fidelity.\\nHe still, however, found time for music. The compositions of the year\\n1814 show a marked advance in maturity. The most important is the first\\nmass, in F, a work that has been pronounced superior to the first mass of\\nany other composer except Beethoven\\'s mass in C. Then we have the second\\nsymphony, in B flat, the overture in Italian style for full orchestra,\\nfive string quartets, eleven dances for strings and horns, and twenty-two\\nsongs, more than half of them to Matthisson\\'s words. Among the songs\\n\"Gretchen am Spinnrade,\" to Goethe\\'s words, is especially to be noted.\\n\\nThe record for the year 1815 is marvellous:--the third symphony, in D, the\\nsecond mass, in G, and the third, in B flat, one opera and six operettas,\\na stabat mater, a salve regina, the string quartet in G minor, four piano\\nsonatas, thirty miscellaneous pieces for the piano, and one hundred and\\nthirty-seven songs! Among the larger of these works the mass in G merits\\nespecial notice for its beauty. Among the songs are some of Schubert\\'s\\nmost famous,--\"Heidenroslein,\" \"Rastlose Liebe,\" the \"Wanderer\\'s\\nNachtlied,\" the exquisite \"Nahe des Geliebten,\" the Ossian songs, and\\nthe magnificent Erl King. This most dramatic and descriptive of songs\\nwas thrown off instantaneously in a fit of wild inspiration. Schubert\\nhad just come upon Goethe\\'s ballad, which he had not seen before; he had\\nread it two or three times and was dashing the music upon paper when his\\nfriend Spaun came in and found him. It was all done in a few moments, the\\nrushing accompaniment and all; and that same evening it was sung at the\\n_Convict_ before Schubert\\'s friends and devoted admirers, his old teachers\\nand fellow pupils. It was quite customary for Schubert to carry his new\\ncompositions there to be tried, and he was wont to find warm sympathy and\\nappreciation. But the Erl King was received rather coldly, as will be\\nhereafter explained.\\n\\nThis year 1816 saw one hundred and thirty-one new compositions by\\nSchubert. Among these were the fourth or \"Tragic\" symphony, in C minor,\\nthe fifth symphony, in B flat, an overture for full orchestra, a concerto\\nfor violin and orchestra, a rondo for violin and string orchestra, one\\nstring quartet, one string trio, seven pieces of dance music for piano,\\nthree sonatinas for piano and violin, and other piano music. There was\\nan unfinished opera, \"Die Burgschaft,\" followed by four cantatas; one,\\ncalled \"Prometheus,\" was the first work composed by Schubert for money;\\nit was written in a single day and the honorarium was one hundred florins\\nin Viennese currency; the occasion was the name-day of a certain Herr\\nHeinrich Watteroth, of Vienna. Another similar but slighter work was\\ncomposed in honor of Herr Joseph Spendon, chief inspector of schools;\\na third was for Schubert\\'s father; the fourth was for the occasion of\\nSalieri\\'s jubilee hereafter to be mentioned. Among the sacred compositions\\nwas a magnificat for solo and mixed voices with accompaniment of violin,\\nviola, hautboy, bassoon, trumpet, drum, and organ; the duetto \"Auguste\\njam Cœlestium\" for soprano and tenor voices, accompanied by violins and\\nvioloncello, double-bass, bassoon, and hautboy; the \"Tantum ergo\" for four\\nvoices and orchestra; the fragment of a requiem in E flat; the \"Salve\\nregina\" for four voices and orchestra; and especially the noble \"Stabat\\nmater\" in F minor, one of the finest of Schubert\\'s earlier contributions\\nto church music. Of this year\\'s songs ninety-nine have been preserved,\\nincluding the Wanderer, the three songs of the Harper in \"Wilhelm\\nMeister,\" Mignon\\'s \"Sehnsucht,\" and \"Kennst du das Land,\" \"Der Konig in\\nThule,\" and \"Jager\\'s Abendlied.\" These songs are remarkable for strength,\\noriginality, and exquisite beauty. In the Wanderer, and \"Wer nie sein Brod\\nmit Thranen ass,\" we find Schubert at an elevation which he afterward\\nscarcely surpassed.\\n\\nIt was Schubert\\'s custom, from an early age, to have quartet parties at\\nhis father\\'s house on Sunday afternoons. When at the _Convict_ he used\\nto go home on Sundays for this purpose. As first arranged, the elder\\nSchubert used to play the \\'cello, Ferdinand first violin, Ignaz second,\\nand Franz the viola. In those early days, if a wrong note was heard from\\nthe \\'cello, young Franz would modestly say, \"Father, there must be a\\nmistake somewhere,\" and the hint was always well received. These Sunday\\nquartets were often joined by friends and neighbors. By degrees the number\\nof violins was increased, a double-bass and sundry wind instruments were\\nadded, and the affair grew into an orchestra which could perform Haydn\\'s\\nand Mozart\\'s symphonies. Presently it became necessary to have the\\nperformances in a larger house, and in this way two or three moves were\\nmade, and the Orchestral Society of Amateurs was organized. Overtures\\nby Cherubini, Spontini, Boieldieu, and Mehul, and the first and second\\nsymphonies of Beethoven were performed. It was for this Society that\\nSchubert wrote his fourth and fifth symphonies and other orchestral works.\\nIn the autumn of 1820 the society broke down, as such societies are apt to\\ndo, under its own weight. It became necessary to have a large public hall\\nfor the meetings, and the expense thus entailed put an end to the pleasant\\nand instructive enterprise. There can be little doubt that it was of much\\nuse to Schubert in giving him a chance to hear his own instrumental works\\nperformed and criticised. To a young man of his extremely modest and\\nretiring disposition, moreover, the friendships thus formed were of much\\nvalue.\\n\\nSchubert was a man to whom friends became devotedly attached. He was\\nfaithful and true, a man of thoroughly sound character, disinterested\\nand unselfish, without a particle of envy or jealousy about him. He won\\naffection without demanding it or seeming to need it. He was one of\\nthose men whom one naturally and instinctively loves. Among his special\\nfriends we have already mentioned Spaun. Toward the end of 1814 he became\\nacquainted with the poet Johann Mayrhofer, about ten years his senior,\\nand the acquaintance ripened into a life-long intimacy. Mayrhofer was\\na man of eccentric nature, with a tinge of melancholy, possibly an\\nincipient symptom of the insanity which many years afterward drove him\\nto suicide. Perhaps the most interesting feature of his intimacy with\\nSchubert was the powerful influence which the latter\\'s music exercised\\nupon the development of his poetical genius. It was under the spell of\\nSchubert\\'s charm that Mayrhofer\\'s best poems came to blossom; and many of\\nthem were set to music by Schubert, among which \"Erlasse,\" \"Sehnsucht,\"\\n\"Nachtstuck,\" \"Die zurnende Diana,\" \"Der Alpenjager,\" \"Der Schiffer,\" \"Am\\nStrome,\" and \"Schlummerlied\" deserve especial mention.\\n\\nAnother of Schubert\\'s friends, and the one who probably exerted the most\\ninfluence upon him, was Franz von Schober. Their acquaintance began at\\na critical moment. After three years of faithful and conscientious work\\nin school-teaching, Schubert began to find the drudgery of his position\\nintolerable, and in 1816, as a public school of music was about to be\\nopened as an appendage to the normal school at Laybach, near Trieste,\\nhe applied for the post of director. To appreciate the situation, we\\nmust not fail to note the amount of the director\\'s salary, five hundred\\nViennese florins, or about one hundred dollars, a year! Such was the\\ncoveted income to which the _alternative_ seemed to be for Schubert, in\\nHerr Kreissle\\'s phrase, \"an impecunious future.\" From Salieri and from\\nSpendon recommendations were obtained, such as they were. There was\\nnothing cordial in them, nothing to indicate that Schubert was a person\\nof greater calibre than a certain commonplace Jacob Schaufl who obtained\\nthe appointment instead of him. Perhaps, however, they may only have\\ndoubted Schubert\\'s capacity for a position of executive responsibility.\\nIt was at this juncture that young Schober came upon the scene, a student\\nin comfortable circumstances, about eighteen years of age, who came to\\nVienna to continue his studies. He had fallen in with some of Schubert\\'s\\nsongs a year or two before, and had conceived an enthusiastic admiration\\nfor the composer. When he found that the wonderful genius was a boy of\\nabout his own age, wearing out his nerves in a school room, and yet\\nturning off divine music by the ream, he made up his mind to interpose. He\\ncould at least offer a home, and he persuaded Schubert to come and occupy\\nhis rooms with him. There Schubert began to give music lessons, but his\\nearnings do not seem to have been considerable or constant. With Schober\\nhe remained a chum for some time, until the need of room for Schober\\'s\\nbrother, a captain of hussars, led to a temporary change. From 1819 to\\n1821 Schubert had rooms with his friend Mayrhofer. After 1821 he lived\\nnearly all the time with Schober until within a few weeks of his death.\\nTheir acquaintances were in the main a set of fine, cultivated young men\\nwho felt strong affection and respect for the inspired musician. Among\\nSchubert\\'s songs we find several set to Schober\\'s words, among which we\\nmay mention \"Pax vobiscum\" and \"Du holde Kunst, in wieviel grauen Stunden.\"\\n\\nThe third of the friends whose names are inseparably associated with\\nSchubert was not one of the circle of young men just referred to, but a\\nmuch older person. Johann Michael Vogl was nearly thirty years older than\\nSchubert. In his youth he had had some monastic training and had afterward\\nstudied law and practised at the bar, but his rich baritone voice and\\nhis love for music led him in time to become a public singer, and for\\neight-and-twenty years he was a member of the German Opera Company. In\\nan epoch notable for its great dramatic singers he was rated high, not\\nso much for his vocal method as for the native quality of his voice and\\nhis intelligent and sympathetic rendering of his parts. He was a learned\\nman, widely read in philosophy and theology, with a deeply religious\\nnature and an intense feeling for music,--not a bad sort of man to sing\\nSchubert\\'s songs. It was in 1817 that Vogl first became aware of these\\ntreasures. Schober pestered him to come and see his wonderful friend and\\ntry some of his songs, but it was not the first time that this veteran\\nhad heard of wonderful young men, and he did not want to be bored. After\\na while, however, he called one evening, hummed through half a dozen\\nsongs--among them \"Ganymed\" and \"Des Schafer\\'s Klage\"--and became more\\nand more interested. \"Well, young man,\" he observed, on taking his leave,\\n\"there is stuff in you, but you squander your fine thoughts instead of\\nmaking the most of them.\" But the more Vogl thought about the songs the\\nmore they loomed up in his memory as strangely and wondrously beautiful.\\nHe called again at the young composer\\'s room, uninvited, found more\\nand more music which riveted his attention, and it was not long before\\nthat house became one of his haunts. It was this intelligent and highly\\ncultivated singer who first made Schubert known beyond the limited circle\\nof his early friends and school-mates. People in the fashionable society\\nof Vienna made their first acquaintance with the Wanderer and the Erl\\nKing as sung by Vogl\\'s rich voice and in his noble style, with Schubert\\nhimself at the piano. Presently this furnished a new career for Vogl. In\\n1821 circumstances led to the discontinuance of his work at the Opera\\nHouse, and he then began giving concerts, in which German _Lieder_ were\\nsung, and those of Schubert occupied a foremost place. In 1825 the two\\nfriends made a little concert tour together in the Salzburg country and\\nUpper Austria. By that time the new songs were becoming famous, though\\none serious obstacle to the wide diffusion of their popularity was the\\nwant of singers able to grapple with their technical difficulties and to\\nexpress their poetical sentiment in an artistic manner. Operatic quips\\nand cranks and wanton flourishes would by no means answer the purpose.\\nOld conventional methods were of no use. A passage from Vogl\\'s diary is\\nworth quoting in this connection for the glimpse it gives us of his fine\\nartistic intelligence:--\"Nothing shows so plainly the want of a good\\nschool of singing as Schubert\\'s songs. Otherwise, what an enormous and\\nuniversal effect must have been produced throughout the world, wherever\\nthe German language is understood, by these truly divine inspirations,\\nthese utterances of a musical _clairvoyance!_ How many would have\\ncomprehended, probably for the first time, the meaning of such expressions\\nas \\'speech and poetry in music,\\' \\'words in harmony,\\' \\'ideas clothed in\\nmusic,\\' etc., and would have learned that the finest poems of our greatest\\npoets may be enhanced and even transcended when translated into musical\\nlanguage! Numberless examples may be named, but I will mention only the\\nErl King, Gretchen am Spinnrade, Schwager Kronos, the Mignon and Harper\\'s\\nsongs, Schiller\\'s Sehnsucht, Der Pilgrim, and Die Burgschaft.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Bauernfeld.

This grouping of Schubert\\'s friends is made by poetical\\nlicense_.]\\n\\nNo subsequent year of Schubert\\'s life witnessed so great a number of\\ncompositions as 1816. For the next year eighty-six compositions are given\\nin Sir George Grove\\'s list. Of these fifty-two are songs, including many\\nof those set to Mayrhofer\\'s words. The two songs to Schober\\'s words, above\\nmentioned, came in this year. Special mention should also be made of the\\n\"Gruppe aus dem Tartarus,\" to Schiller\\'s words, and of \"Lob der Thranen\"\\nand \"Die Forelle.\" \"The Pilgrim\" and \"Ganymede\" also belong to this time.\\nOf large compositions for piano there were the sonatas in E minor; B, Op.\\n147; A minor, Op. 164; F minor; and A flat; besides the sonata in A, Op.\\n162, for piano and violin. There were also the variations for piano on a\\ntheme of Huttenbrenner\\'s; an adagio and rondo; two scherzos, and seventeen\\ndances for piano; a set of polonaises for violin; and a string trio. The\\nsixth symphony, in C, was written or finished in November, 1817, and\\nperformed by the amateur orchestral company above described. There were\\nalso three overtures, of which two, written in the Italian style, remind\\nus that 1817 was the year in which Rossini\\'s operas, newly introduced to\\nVienna, were received with wild enthusiasm. Schubert was altogether too\\nfar above Rossini\\'s plane of thought to feel such interest in his work as\\nhe felt for the masterpieces of polyphonic composition. But he appreciated\\nhighly the Italian\\'s gift of melody, and with the assimilative power which\\nis wont to characterize great genius, he took hints from him which are\\napparent not only in the two Italian overtures, but perhaps also in the\\nsixth symphony. Or in other words, as all creative work is influenced by\\nits environment, there was a discernible Rossini tinge in the atmosphere\\nwhich Schubert was for the moment breathing, and it has left its slight\\ntraces upon a few of his compositions for that year, as upon the work of\\nless potent creators it left many and deep impressions.\\n\\nThe year 1818 witnessed the beginning of an episode in Schubert\\'s life,\\nquite different in many respects from what had preceded. He was engaged by\\nCount Esterhazy to teach music in his family. There were two daughters,\\nMarie, aged thirteen, and Caroline, aged eleven, and a son aged five.\\nAll were musically gifted, and their friend, Baron von Schonstein, was\\na very accomplished singer. The engagement took Schubert to the Count\\'s\\ncountry home in Hungary for the summer, while the winter season was\\npassed in Vienna. Schubert\\'s intercourse with this amiable and cultivated\\nfamily was very pleasant, and in the course of it seems to have occurred\\nthe nearest approach to a love affair that can be detected in his life.\\nLittle Caroline Esterhazy was at the outset not at an age likely to evoke\\nthe tender passion. But as time elapsed and she came to be seventeen or\\neighteen years of age, it has been supposed that Schubert manifested\\nsymptoms of having fallen in love with her. The evidence is slight, as\\nevidence is apt to be in such matters, in the absence of anything like\\nan overt declaration. The nearest that Schubert seems ever to have come\\nto such a declaration was once when Caroline in an innocent moment of\\ngirlish coquetry asked him why, when he was dedicating so many delightful\\nworks to other persons, he had never dedicated anything to her. Schubert\\nis said to have replied, \"Why should I? Is not everything that I have\\never done dedicated to you already?\" This anecdote does not go far as\\nproof. Question and answer might alike have been merely pleasant jesting.\\nContemporary rumor, in the case of a man so shy and reserved on all\\nmatters of deep feeling as Schubert, cannot be expected to tell us much.\\nThe general impression about him was that he was almost insensible to\\nthe charms of fair women. If this impression is to be taken as true, an\\ninteresting question is suggested. How could a man who was never in love\\nhave written that immortal Serenade in which all that is sweetest and most\\nsacred in the love of man for woman comes forth like a fresh breath from\\nheaven? Never was voice of love so passionate and so pure. Nowhere has\\nhuman art ever found more consummate and faultless expression than in this\\nsong of songs. It could no more have come from a soul insensible to the\\npassion of love than figs can grow upon thistles. Probably therefore the\\ngeneral impression about Schubert was due in the main to his reticence.\\nWe have also to bear in mind that such a nature as his can find in\\nartistic creation a vent for emotional excitement strong enough to craze\\nthe ordinary mind. We know how it was with Goethe, how the worst pains\\nof life were healed for him by being thrown off in passionate poetry.\\nThis is quite intelligible. It is a special illustration of Shakespeare\\'s\\ninjunction:--\\n\\n    \"Give sorrow words; the grief that cannot speak\\n    Whispers the o\\'erfraught heart and bids it break.\"\\n\\nThis need for expression, felt by every human creature, appears in men\\nof profound and intense interior life as a creative impulse; it is\\nso not only with artists and poets, but in many cases with scholars,\\nphilosophers, and scientific discoverers; the relief is found in giving\\nobjective form to the thoughts that come welling up from the depths of the\\nspirit. But it is in art that creative expression most becomes in itself\\nan overmastering end, and especially in the two arts that give swiftest\\nand readiest outlet to emotion, in poetry and in music. Hence one of the\\nnoblest functions of art, to be the consoler of the troubled soul, to\\nsink its individual sorrows in the contemplation of eternal beauty, to\\nbring weary and doubting humanity into restful communion with the divine\\nsource of all its yearnings, in the faith that they have not been given\\nus for naught. If there ever was a soul thus sustained and comforted, it\\nwas the pure and earnest soul of Schubert; the stream of song that flowed\\nfrom him was like the ecstatic but soothing and strengthening prayer of\\nthe mediæval saint. One can see that this shy and sensitive young man,\\nsomewhat inclined withal to self-depreciation, would not be quick to avow\\na love which social conditions at any rate scarcely favored. He was son of\\na peasant, Caroline Esterhazy was daughter of a count. Such a passion was\\nlikely to seek relief in strains of music, as Dante\\'s worship of Beatrice\\nfound expression in verse. As the thought of Beatrice was in all that\\nDante wrote, so the story of Schubert\\'s momentary confession to Caroline\\nthat all that he had sung was dedicated to her is in nowise improbable\\nin itself. There is a circumstance which invests it with a considerable\\ndegree of probability. Shortly after Schubert\\'s death his beautiful\\nFantasia in F minor, Op. 103, was published with the inscription,\\n\"Dedicated to the Countess Caroline Esterhazy by Franz Schubert,\" and Sir\\nGeorge Grove rightly infers that the publishers would hardly have ventured\\nupon such a step \"unless the manuscript--probably handed to them before\\nhis death--had been so inscribed by himself.\" This is perhaps all that is\\nknown concerning the question as to Schubert\\'s love.\\n\\nAt the Esterhazy country-house Schubert seems at first to have felt more\\nat home in the kitchen than in the drawing-room. A letter to Schober,\\nwritten in September, 1818, says:--\"The cook is a pleasant fellow; the\\nladies\\' maid is thirty; the housemaid very pretty, and often pays me a\\nvisit; the nurse is somewhat ancient; the butler is my rival; the two\\ngrooms get on better with the horses than with us. The Count is a little\\nrough; the Countess proud, but not without heart; the young ladies good\\nchildren.\" It was not long before Schubert found himself a great favorite\\nwith the whole household, from the count down to the grooms. From this\\ntime until his death he was always welcome whenever he chose to come,\\nBaron von Schonstein, the singer already mentioned, had hitherto sung\\nnothing but Italian music, but he was now converted to the German Lied,\\nand for the rest of his life devoted himself to Schubert\\'s songs, until\\nfor his magnificent rendering of them he acquired a fame scarcely second\\nto Vogl.\\n\\nDuring the winter seasons in Vienna, Schubert continued to give music\\nlessons in the Esterhazy family, but his home was apt to be in the\\nhumble room with Mayrhofer, or afterwards again with Schober. He was\\nas regular with his work of composing music as Anthony Trollope with\\nhis novel-writing or Sainte-Beuve with his \"Causeries du Lundi.\" When\\nFerdinand Hiller was about sixteen years old he made a visit to Vienna\\nand called upon Schubert. \"Do you write much?\" asked Hiller,--a question\\nwhich now sounds odd enough, and shows how little knowledge of the great\\ncomposer there was outside of his own town. \"I write every morning,\" said\\nSchubert, \"and as soon as I have finished one thing I begin another.\" This\\nregularity was simply an outcome of the fact that the fount of inspiration\\nwas never dry. It was not because it was work done for much needed money,\\nfor the larger part of Schubert\\'s work never brought him any money. It was\\nprimarily because singing was as spontaneous with him on first awaking as\\nwith a bird; sometimes he could not wait to get up and dress, but seized\\na sheet of music paper and jotted down his first exuberant thoughts while\\nstill in bed. After a piece was finished, he sometimes heard it sung or\\nplayed, and sometimes did not; in either case it was apt soon to be tucked\\naway in a cupboard drawer and forgotten; there are several anecdotes of\\nhis listening to old songs of his own without recognizing them.\\n\\nAfter working till two o\\'clock in the afternoon, Schubert used to dine,\\nand then visit friends, or take a walk, or sit in a cafe over his schoppen\\nof wine or beer. At such times, as we have seen, the sight of a poem, or\\nperhaps some interesting incident, would call forth a sudden outburst of\\nsong. Some of his noblest masterpieces came from the beer garden. He does\\nnot seem to have been in the habit of drinking anything stronger than beer\\nand wine. Of these light beverages he was very fond, and as his head was\\neasily affected, an opinion has found currency that this appetite was a\\nweakness with Schubert,--perhaps his only assignable weakness. The fact,\\nhowever, that he was always up early and quite fresh for the morning\\'s\\nwork, is clear proof that it could not have been a serious weakness. Among\\nfriends with whom he was well acquainted he was genial and jovial, and\\nliked to sit and talk; but he habitually entertained a due respect for\\nto-morrow morning.\\n\\nThe compositions for the three years 1818-20 were about a hundred in\\nnumber. There were some noble church works, the fourth mass in C and the\\nfifth in A flat, a Salve Regina for soprano voice with string orchestra,\\nfour hymns by Novalis, the twenty-third Psalm to Moses Mendelssohn\\'s\\nversion, and the Easter cantata \"Lazarus\"; also the operetta \"Die\\nZwillingsbruder\" and the fragment of an unfinished opera, \"Sakuntala\";\\nan overture for orchestra, quartetts, quintets, canzoni, many dances for\\npiano, and many songs.\\n\\nThe year 1821 marked a new era with Schubert; in that year some of his\\ncompositions were first published. Some of his friends were determined to\\nhave a group of his songs engraved, among them the Erl King which had now\\noften been heard in private concerts. They applied to two or three of the\\nmost enterprising music publishers in Vienna, but without success. There\\nwas no profit in such publications, said the sagacious men of business.\\nThe composer was so obscure that his name would carry no weight; and as\\nfor the songs, they were strange affairs, the melodies too difficult for\\nanybody to sing, and the piano accompaniments quite impossible for any one\\nto play! As the publishers thus proved unmanageable, some of Schubert\\'s\\nfriends had the Erl King engraved and printed by subscription, and about\\nthe same time the song was first heard at Vienna in a public concert,\\nwith the accompaniment played by the composer himself. It was in this\\nyear, as already observed, that Vogl began giving concerts in which these\\nsongs took a prominent place. In the course of a few months seven groups\\nof Schubert\\'s songs were published on commission, and their success was\\nsuch that publishers were afterward ready to go on at their own risk. Of\\nnew compositions this year saw the completion of the beautiful \"Gesang\\nder Geister uber den Wassern\" for four tenors and four basses, with\\naccompaniment of two violas, two \\'cellos, and double-bass. There was also\\nthe seventh symphony, for the most part a sketch, but so full of clues\\nthat it would not be difficult to complete it according to the original\\nintention. It looks as if the composer had some other work upon his\\nmind at the same time, perhaps the Alfonso and Estrella presently to be\\nmentioned, and could not for the moment wait to fill out all parts of the\\nscore, but made very complete indications so as to be sure of recovering\\nhis former thoughts on returning to it. Among this year\\'s songs are some\\nthat rank very high, as the two Suleikas and the \"Geheimes\" to Goethe\\'s\\nwords, the \"Lob der Thranen\" and \"Sey mir gegrusst.\" All these are\\noutdone, however, by the \"Fruhlingsglaube,\" written in 1822, to Uhland\\'s\\nwords, a song which for artistic perfection is absolutely unsurpassed.\\n\\nThe rapid development of Schubert\\'s maturity in 1822 is exhibited in the\\ntwo movements of his eighth symphony in B-minor, now commonly called the\\nUnfinished Symphony. It was written for the Musikverein at Gratz, which\\nhad lately elected him an honorary member. Why it was presented to the\\nsociety while still half-finished does not clearly appear. The first two\\nmovements were completed and the scherzo partly sketched. It is now more\\noften played and better known than any of his other symphonies except\\nthe great tenth, in C major, presently to be mentioned. There is greater\\nconciseness of expression, and in the opinion of some critics, even more\\ngrandeur and beauty in the Unfinished Symphony than in the Tenth. Here\\nfor the first time in an orchestral work Schubert appears as a completely\\nindependent master. In his earlier symphonies, as in Beethoven\\'s first\\nand second, one always feels the dominant influence of Haydn and Mozart.\\nIn his sixth symphony, composed in 1817, we begin to see the influence of\\nBeethoven, for whom he was already coming to feel the love and adoration\\nthat never ceased to occupy his mind even upon his death-bed. In the\\nUnfinished Symphony he takes a new departure, as Beethoven did in his\\nthird or Eroica; but this new departure, while it profits by Beethoven,\\nis peculiarly Schubertian; the composer\\'s individuality is as completely\\nexpressed in it as in his songs.\\n\\nWe have already had occasion to mention operas or operettas in the lists\\nof our composer\\'s works from year to year. His insatiable yearning to\\nexpress himself in music was excited whenever he happened to come across\\nan available dramatic poem, good or bad, and sometimes he was fain to\\ncontent himself with a wretched libretto. Hitherto his music for the stage\\nhad been of much less importance than his other compositions, though\\nit hardly need be said that it abounded in beautiful and interesting\\nconceptions. But the increase of maturity just noticed in his orchestral\\nmusic was also shown in the production of his first grand opera, \"Alfonso\\nand Estrella,\" in 1822, followed by his second and last such work,\\n\"Fierabras,\" in 1823.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of manuscript of first sketch of the Erl King,\\nshowing that the change of the right-hand accompaniment into triplets was\\nan afterthought.]\\n\\nIn the autumn of 1821 Schubert and his friend Schober took a bit of\\nvacation among the Styrian Alps, where something suggested a subject\\nfor the romantic opera, \"Alfonso and Estrella,\" and Schober wrote a\\nlibretto so much better than anything our hero had yet had to work with\\nthat it quite made his eyes sparkle. It may be doubted if Don Quixote\\'s\\nhousekeeper would have kept back even this libretto from the flames,\\nbut of many a musical drama that has solaced the weary mind we may say\\nthat it was not made to be analyzed. An opera should be judged not by\\nthe element that would instantly evaporate in a logical crucible, but by\\nthe opportunities it affords for dramatic situations. In this respect\\nthe Schober libretto, though better than Schubert had ever worked with,\\nhad its shortcomings; the situations were given, but not wrought up with\\nsufficient dramatic power, so that, in spite of the undeniable dramatic\\ngenius of the composer, the general treatment was felt to be more\\nlyric than dramatic. The opera was also regarded as too long, and the\\naccompaniments were pronounced impossible by the orchestras at the Vienna\\ntheatres. For these reasons it proved impossible to get it put upon the\\nstage. It was first performed at Weimar in 1854, under Liszt\\'s direction,\\nbut was coldly received. At length it was curtailed and simplified by\\nJohann Fuchs, and brought out at Carlsruhe in 1881, and since then it has\\nbeen performed many times with marked success. The overture, a superb\\npiece of orchestral writing, is often performed at concerts.\\n\\nThis opera was the occasion of a little tiff between Schubert and\\nWeber, who came to Vienna in 1823 to conduct his opera \"Euryanthe.\" On\\nhearing that work performed, Schubert said that along with many beauties\\nin harmony and in dramatic treatment it was wanting in freshness and\\noriginality of melody, and was on the whole quite inferior to its\\npredecessor, \"Der Freischutz.\" Probably few would dissent from this\\njudgment to-day, but when it was repeated to Weber it naturally irritated\\nhim, and he is said to have exclaimed, \"The dunce had better learn to\\ndo something himself before he presumes to sit in judgment on me.\"\\nThis hasty remark was tattled about until Schubert heard of it, and\\nforthwith, armed with the score of \"Alfonso and Estrella,\" he called upon\\nthe famous northern composer, to prove that he had not spoken without\\nknowing how operas ought to be written. After looking through the score\\nWeber ungraciously observed, \"You know it is customary for people to\\ndrown the first puppies and the first operas!\" Poor health was already\\nmaking Weber irritable, and this remark was only an expiring flicker of\\npeevishness. He did not regard \"Alfonso and Estrella\" as a puppy opera,\\nbut admired it, and afterward tried, though unsuccessfully, to have it\\nperformed in Dresden. The relations between the two composers seem to have\\nbeen friendly. Indeed Schubert never bore malice to anybody, and it was\\nimpossible for any one to harbor an unkind feeling toward him.\\n\\nOf \"Fierabras\" it need only be said that the libretto was a bad one, the\\nscene was Spain in the days of Carlovingian romance, the score filled\\none thousand manuscript pages, and the opera was never performed. The\\nromances, entr\\'actes, choruses, and ballet music, written this year for\\nthe drama of \"Rosamunde,\" rank among the composer\\'s most beautiful works,\\nand are often performed as concert-pieces, though the drama itself has\\nbeen lost.\\n\\nDuring part of this year 1823 Schubert was ill and obliged to go to the\\nhospital. Yet besides all this quantity of operatic music, he composed\\nthe cycle of twenty songs known as \"Die schone Mullerin,\" to the words of\\nWilhelm Muller, containing the exquisite \"Wohin?,\" \"Ungeduld,\" \"Trockne\\nBlumen,\" and others scarcely less beautiful. Some of these were written in\\nthe hospital. As if this were not enough, the same year\\'s list contains\\n\"Du bist die Ruh,\" and \"Auf dem Wasser zu singen\"; as well as the piano\\nsonata in A minor, Op. 143.\\n\\nThe year 1824 was marked chiefly by piano compositions,--two sonatas and\\nan overture for four hands, besides a vast quantity of dance music, and\\nthe \"Divertissement a l\\'hongroise,\" suggested by an air hummed by the\\nkitchen maid at the Esterhazys\\' country house, where Schubert spent the\\nsummer to recruit his health. There was also a string quartet, and the\\ncelebrated octet for strings and wood which is now so familiar. This\\nactivity in the sonata form seems to have culminated next year in the\\nninth symphony, which was almost surely finished about August, 1825, but\\nwhich has quite disappeared from sight. There were three piano sonatas,\\nbesides the fragment of a fourth. Of these the sonata in A minor, Op.\\n42, must probably be pronounced the greatest of Schubert\\'s works for the\\npiano, showing along with its wealth of inventiveness a mastery of form\\nalmost as complete as the best of the songs. Among the grand songs of\\nthis year must be mentioned \"Die junge Nonne,\" and the group of seven to\\nScott\\'s \"Lady of the Lake,\" of which the most famous is the \"Ave Maria.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: SCHUBERT\\'S MONUMENT IN VIENNA.--From a photograph.]\\n\\nOur composer\\'s progress toward perfect achievement in instrumental music\\nis marked in 1826 by the two string quartets in G and D minor. The latter\\nis not only Schubert\\'s greatest work in chamber music, but is hardly\\nsurpassed by the work of any other composer in this department. At the\\nsame time came the piano sonata in G, Op. 78, of remarkable breadth and\\ngrandeur. The Shakespeare songs already mentioned belong to this year.\\n\\nAmong the works of 1827 the most memorable was the second grand cycle\\nof songs to words by Wilhelm Muller,--the immortal \"Winterreise.\" These\\njewels of lyric art, what lover of music will fail to know them, so long\\nas art endures? But a more sombre tone prevails in them than the songster\\nhad sustained at such length before. The note of unsatisfied longing,\\nof the strange contrast between the glow of aspiration and the chill\\nreality, is most decisively struck in \"Fruhlingstraum.\" In the last of the\\ncycle, the pathetic \"Leiermann,\" the sadness is only heightened by the\\nindescribably delicate and playful humor which hovers about the phrases.\\nTo us it may seem as if these lyrics contained a premonition of the end\\nthat was not far off; but probably Schubert did not suspect it. His\\ngrandest outburst of creative power was yet to come; he was studying his\\nart more earnestly than ever, and in the true spirit of artist or scholar,\\nas if all eternity lay before him, though the dread summons might come\\nto-morrow; in the sweet words of the old monkish distich:--\\n\\n    \"Disce ut semper victurus,\\n    Vive ut eras moriturus.\"\\n\\nOf worldly sources of strength and comfort this great spirit had so few as\\nto put to shame such weaker mortals as complain of the ways of Providence.\\nOf what is called business and its management he was as innocent as a babe\\nin arms. His reticence, his unwillingness to intrude upon others, often\\nprevented his friends from realizing the straits to which he was reduced.\\nThere can be little doubt that even at this later period of life he\\nsometimes suffered from cold and hunger, and it has been thought that his\\ndeath was hastened by such privations. Salaried positions that he might\\nhave creditably filled were given to men with more self-assertion. His\\nattempts at the more marketable forms of music, as opera was then deemed\\nto be, failed from various untoward conditions; and he would sometimes\\nsell for the price of a frugal breakfast a song destined to bring wealth\\nto some publisher. The genial musician, Franz Lachner, declares from\\npersonal knowledge that half a dozen numbers of the \"Winterreise\" were\\nwritten in a single day and sold for a franc apiece! If Schubert had\\nlived longer there would probably have been an improvement in this state\\nof things. The greatness of his posthumous fame is liable to make us\\nforget that his life was ended at an age when the most brilliant men are\\nusually just beginning to win their earliest laurels. From 1822 to 1828\\nhis reputation was increasing rapidly, and before long would have become\\nso great as probably to work some improvement in his affairs. With time\\nthe recognition of his genius was to seize the whole musical world as it\\nseized upon Beethoven.\\n\\nThe story of the relations between these two artists is touching. It seems\\nsingular enough that Schubert and Beethoven should have lived in the same\\ncity for thirty years without meeting more than once until the very end.\\nBy his twentieth year, if not before, the feeling of Schubert for the\\nolder composer had come to be little short of adoration. But Beethoven was\\nabsorbed in work, and stone deaf withal, and not always easy of approach,\\nand his adorer was timid. Sometimes he came into the cafe where Schubert\\nwas dining and sat down at another table. For a man of the world to get\\nup, step across the room, and open a conversation with the demigod, might\\nseem no very difficult undertaking; for Schubert it was simply impossible.\\nBut in 1822 a meeting was at length brought about. His \"Variations on a\\nFrench Air\" were published by Diabelli and dedicated to Beethoven, and\\nDiabelli took Schubert with him to the master\\'s house to present the\\noffering in person. Beethoven received the visitors graciously, and paper\\nand pencil for conversation were handed to them as usual, but Schubert\\nwas too confused to write a word. Most likely it was Diabelli who handed\\nto Beethoven the Variations and called his attention to the tribute of\\nadmiration printed at their head. On looking over the music Beethoven\\nstumbled upon some daring or questionable innovation of style, and in\\nhis most kindly manner turned to Schubert to inquire his reason for it,\\nor perhaps to make some mild criticism quite proper from an artist of\\nfifty-two years to one of twenty-five. At this the poor fellow simply lost\\nhis head, and with some incoherent exclamation fled into the street. Ah,\\nwhat chagrin when once safely alone, and the very thing he ought to have\\nsaid, so neat and telling, popped into his head! But to go back, or to\\nspeak to the great man again seemed more than ever impossible.\\n\\nIt was during Beethoven\\'s last illness in 1827 that he first came to\\nknow Schubert. Beethoven\\'s friend and biographer Schindler brought him a\\nparcel of Schubert\\'s songs, including the \"Schone Mullerin\" group, \"Die\\njunge Nonne,\" and others. Beethoven\\'s astonishment and admiration knew\\nno bounds. He studied the songs with most profound interest, declared\\nthat their composer was destined to become a great power in the world,\\nand expressed deep regret that he had not known more about him. Scarcely\\na day passed without his reverting to the subject, and it must of course\\nhave been this that led Schubert to visit him twice. On the first occasion\\nthere was some affectionate talk between them; on the second the dying\\nman was no longer able to speak, but only made some unintelligible signs,\\nand Schubert went away bowed down with grief. At the funeral he was one\\nof the torch-bearers, and on the way home from the graveyard he stopped\\nwith Lachner and another friend at the Mehlgrube tavern, and they drank a\\nglass of wine to the memory of the mighty master who had left them. Then\\nSchubert proposed a second glass to that one of themselves who should be\\nthe first to follow. It was to be himself, and very soon.\\n\\n[Illustration: VIEW IN CEMETERY AT VIENNA, SHOWING TOMBS OF BEETHOVEN,\\nMOZART AND SCHUBERT.\\n\\nFrom a photograph.]\\n\\nAn instance of the rapidly growing interest in his music was furnished\\nby the success of a private concert which he gave for his own benefit\\nearly in 1828. The programme consisted entirely of his own compositions,\\nthe audience was large and enthusiastic, and the sum, equivalent to one\\nhundred and sixty dollars, which that evening brought him, must have\\ngiven him an unwonted sense of wealth. It was his first and last concert\\nof this sort. For creative work this last year of his life was the most\\nwonderful, and indeed it would be difficult to cite from the whole history\\nof music a parallel to it. The one orchestral work was the colossal tenth\\nsymphony in C major, which showed so unmistakably upon whose shoulders the\\nmantle of the dead master had fallen, that it used sometimes to be called\\n\"Beethoven\\'s tenth symphony.\" But there is no imitation of Beethoven\\nor any other master in this work; it is as individually and intensely\\nSchubertian as the Erl King. It was first performed in Vienna about a\\nmonth after its composer\\'s death, but its technical difficulties caused it\\nto lie neglected and forgotten until 1838, when Robert Schumann carried\\nthe score to Leipsic and studied it with Mendelssohn; and it was again\\ngiven to the world, under Mendelssohn\\'s direction, in the following year.\\nSince then it has been one of the best known and most thoroughly loved of\\nall the symphonies written since Beethoven\\'s, and it ranks undoubtedly\\namong the foremost ten or twelve orchestral masterpieces of the world.\\n\\nSide by side with this symphony sprang into existence the mass in E flat,\\nthe most finished and the most sublime of Schubert\\'s masses, and standing,\\nlike the symphony, in the foremost rank of all works of its kind. And\\nalong with this came the master\\'s first and only oratorio, \"Miriam\\'s Song\\nof Triumph,\" a noble work, in which, however, Schubert only supported\\nthe vocal score with an accompaniment for piano; so that it must be\\nregarded as in this sense incomplete. It has often been performed with\\norchestration by Lachner, but still needs to be completed by some master\\nmore capable of entering into the composer\\'s intention.\\n\\nOutdoing his earlier self in all directions at once, Schubert wrote in\\nthis same year his quintet in C major for strings, which among his works\\nin chamber music is equalled only by the D-minor quartet of 1826. And so,\\ntoo, with his piano music; besides many other works poured forth at this\\ntime, we have three superb sonatas, of which the one in B-flat is dated\\nSeptember 28, less than eight weeks before his death. From all his piano\\nworks it would be hard to select one fuller of his peculiar poetical\\ncharm. Among the sonatas its only peers are the A minor, Op. 42, and the G\\nmajor, Op. 78.\\n\\nIn some of the songs of this year the genius of the composer reached a\\nheight scarcely attained before. Besides a few others, uncounted drops\\nin this ocean of achievement, there were fourteen, not obviously intended\\nas a cycle, but published in a group, soon after Schubert\\'s death, with\\nthe publisher\\'s title, \"Swan Songs.\" It is enough to mention that this\\ngroup contains the \"Serenade,\" \"Aufenthalt,\" and \"Am Meer,\" matchless for\\nintensity of emotion as for artistic perfection of form. Whichever of this\\ngroup he wrote last was truly his swan song; it is commonly believed to\\nhave been the \"Taubenpost,\" dated in October.\\n\\nDuring this last year of marvellous creative activity Schubert had\\nsuffered frequently from headache and vertigo. Such cerebral excitement\\nentailed an excessive rush of blood to the head. Early in September\\nhe moved from his lodgings with Schober to a house which his brother\\nFerdinand had lately taken. The situation was near the open country and\\nthought to be more favorable for air and exercise. Unfortunately the\\nhouse was newly-built and damp; very likely the drainage was defective.\\nSchubert evidently had no suspicion of his dangerous condition, until\\non the last evening of October, while supping with some friends at the\\nRothen Kreuz inn, having taken some fish from his plate he suddenly threw\\ndown his knife and fork, saying that food had become as odious as poison.\\nThis somewhat alarmed his friends, but he was as full of plans for future\\nwork as if his health had been robust. On November 3, he took a long walk\\nto attend the performance of a Latin requiem composed by his brother\\nFerdinand, the last music he ever heard. He had lately begun studying the\\nscores of Handel\\'s oratorios, and had thus become impressed with the fact\\nthat in counterpoint he had still much to learn. Though greatly fatigued\\nwith his walk on November 3, he went next day to see Sechter, a famous\\nteacher of counterpoint, and made arrangements for taking a course of\\nlessons; the text-book and the dates were settled upon. It is doubtful\\nif Schubert ever went out again. The disturbance of the stomach, which\\nprevented him from taking food, continued, and his strength ebbed away. A\\nletter to Schober on the eleventh says that he can barely get from the bed\\nto a chair and back again; he has been reading the Last of the Mohicans,\\nthe Spy, the Pilot, and the Pioneer; and if Schober happens to have\\nanything else of Cooper\\'s, or any other interesting book, he would like\\nto have him send it. Something like typhus fever was setting in. After\\nthe fourteenth he was confined to his bed, but was still able to correct\\nthe proofs of the \"Winterreise.\" On the seventeenth he became delirious.\\nThe next day he complained of having been taken to a strange and dreadful\\nroom, and when his brother Ferdinand tried to soothe him with the\\nassurance that he was at home, he replied, \"No, it cannot be so; Beethoven\\nis not here!\" On the next day there passed away one of the sweetest and\\ntruest souls that ever looked with human eyes. He was buried in the\\nWahring cemetery in a grave as near as possible to that of Beethoven. Upon\\na monument afterward erected at the head of the grave was inscribed the\\nepitaph, by Franz Grillparzer: \"Music has here entombed a rich treasure,\\nbut still more glorious hopes. Here lies Franz Schubert, born Jan. 31,\\n1797, died Nov. 19, 1828, aged 31 years.\" Much fault has been found with\\nthe second clause of this epitaph, and Herr Kreissle does not seem to\\nhave quite understood it as it was meant. It was true, as Schumann said\\nof him, \"He has done enough, and praised be he who, like Schubert, has\\nstriven and accomplished.\" Nevertheless it was equally true that he was\\ncut off while his powers were rapidly expanding, and at a moment when even\\ngreater achievement, though difficult to imagine, would have been no more\\nthan a logical consequence of what had gone before.\\n\\n[Illustration: SCHUBERT\\'S TOMB IN VIENNA.--From a photograph.\\n\\nErected to his memory by the Vienna Manner Gesangs-Verein (Male Chorus).]\\n\\nSchubert\\'s personal appearance was not attractive. He was short and\\nround-shouldered, and in his homely face there was nothing to betray the\\nsacred fire within him save the brightness of the eyes. His character was\\nalmost without a flaw. Simplicity, modesty, kindness, truthfulness, and\\nfidelity were his marked attributes. He was utterly free from envy or\\nmalice, and not a trace of selfishness appears in anything he ever said or\\ndid. His life was devoted, with entire disinterestedness, to the pursuit\\nof the noblest aims of art.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nConcerning his position in the history of music there is but little\\nquestion, and the subject admits of a brief statement. The man who died\\nin his thirty-second year, leaving behind him at least eleven hundred and\\nthirty-one _such_ compositions, must surely be called the most prolific of\\ncomposers, even after allowing for the fact that more than six hundred of\\nthese works were songs, and therefore brief. We may safely say, too, that\\nfor creative spontaneity such a man can never have been surpassed, perhaps\\nscarcely ever have been equalled. This spontaneous genius found its first\\nand most characteristic expression in vocal song, and it is commonly if\\nnot universally agreed that Schubert was the greatest composer of songs\\nthat ever lived. In this department of music he marks an era. In him the\\nGerman Lied reached a plane of development to which it had not attained\\nbefore him.\\n\\nThe German Lied (i.e. Lay) was originally a Volkslied (i.e. Folk\\'s-lay)\\nor popular melody. The merit of popular melody lies largely in its\\nspontaneity. In German popular melody, from the oldest times, the\\nmerit of beauty has been added to that of spontaneity, inasmuch as the\\nGermans, like the Slavs, are naturally musical in a sense in which\\nEnglish-speaking people are not. No German-speaking people would tolerate\\nfor a national air such a tune as Yankee Doodle. In the plainest German\\nfolk-song may be found spontaneous simplicity without vulgarity. Hence\\nthe Volkslied has been available as a source of melodic suggestiveness\\nto German composers. It is one such chief source, the Gregorian chant\\nbeing the other. To the presence of this folk-song element we may largely\\nascribe the far higher poetic quality of German classical music as\\ncompared with the more prosaic musical declamation of the modern French\\nand Italians.\\n\\nBut as the earlier German composers subjected the Volkslied to elaborate\\ncontrapuntal treatment, while on the one hand they added to its range and\\ndepth of expression, on the other hand they deprived it to some extent\\nof its indescribable charm. Artistic music began to be divorced from the\\nVolkslied, and with the advance of musical education the latter seemed to\\nbe falling into decay. But with the revival of German literature which\\ndates from Lessing, there began a new development of national spirit among\\nGermans, of which we have seen the culmination in our own time. One of\\nthe early symptoms was the introduction of the Volkslied element into\\npoetry by Herder and Goethe. About the same time we find the same element\\nappearing in the thematic treatment of symphonies, sonatas, and string\\nquartets by Haydn and Mozart, especially in the adagios. In Mozart\\'s songs\\nthere is a great development in dramatic treatment, as for example, in\\n\"Ungluckliche Liebe.\" The nearest approach made by Mozart to the kind of\\nsong afterward developed by Schubert was probably in \"Das Veilchen,\" the\\nonly one of his songs set to Goethe\\'s words. As Mozart was pre-eminently\\na musical dramatist, so was Beethoven first and foremost a symphonist;\\nand in his songs the most noticeable new feature is the enrichment of the\\nharmonies and the profound increase of significance in the instrumental\\naccompaniments. We see this in the magnificent \"Adelaide,\" which,\\nhowever, resembles an aria rather than a genuine Lied. In some parts of\\nBeethoven\\'s exquisite cycle, \"An die ferne Geliebte,\" he comes nearer to\\nthe Schubertian form of song.\\n\\nNow in Schubert all the elements of intensity, power, and poetical depth\\nin song are found united as never before in such perfection or on such\\na scale. The breadth and vigor of dramatic treatment, the profound and\\nsubtle harmonic changes, the accumulation of effect by the rhythm and\\nsometimes by the independent melodic themes of the accompaniment, are all\\nto be found in his songs; and at the same time the perfect spontaneity and\\nthe indescribable poetical fragrance of the Volkslied are fully preserved.\\nUtterances that spring from the depth of the human soul are clothed in\\nthe highest forms of art without losing their naivete. We must thus rank\\nSchubert among the most consummate masters of expression the world has\\never seen. His songs represent the high-water mark of human achievement\\nin one direction, as Beethoven\\'s symphonies represent it in another.\\nAll subsequent composers, beginning with Mendelssohn and Schumann, have\\nbeen pupils of Schubert in song-writing, but no one has yet equalled the\\nmaster. Mendelssohn\\'s songs, while perfect in form and bewitching for\\ngrace, are far inferior to Schubert\\'s in intensity of passion. On the\\nother hand Schumann has written some songs--such as \"Fruhlingsnacht,\" \"Ich\\ngrolle nicht,\" the \"Frauenliebe\" cycle, and others--which for concentrated\\nfire, as well as for original and magnificent harmonies--almost surpass\\nthose of Schubert; but in wealth of imagination, in spontaneity and\\nvariety, he remains distinctly inferior to his master.\\n\\nIn thus carrying the Lied to the highest point of development it has yet\\nreached, Schubert became one of the chief sources of inspiration for\\nmodern music in all its departments. The influence of his conception of\\nthe Lied is to be seen in all his most highly developed and characteristic\\nwriting for piano, for orchestra, and for chorus. In his earlier\\nsymphonies, quartets, and sonatas he was strongly influenced by his study\\nof Mozart, and his own individuality is by no means so distinctly asserted\\nas in his songs. If the sonata form of expression were as easily caught\\nas the simple song form, this need not have been the case. After Schubert\\nhad mastered the sonata form so that it became for him as easy a vehicle\\nof spontaneous expression as the Lied, his sonatas and symphonies became\\nstrongly characteristic and replete with originality. This is exemplified\\nin his eighth and tenth symphonies, in his piano sonatas, Op. 42 and Op.\\n78, and in his later chamber music. In such compositions he simply worked\\nwithin the forms perfected by Beethoven and did nothing to extend them.\\nBut his musical individuality, saturated with the Lied, impressed upon\\nthese noble works features that have influenced all later instrumental\\nmusic, imparting to it a more romantic character. As Mr. Paine observes,\\n\"we are constantly surprised by the sudden and abrupt modulations,\\nrhythmical effects of melody and accompaniment which we call Schubert\\'s\\nthat give variety and life to his movements. The Unfinished Symphony in B\\nminor is perhaps the most noteworthy in these respects; it is the epitome\\nof his genius, and well typifies his own unfinished but perfect life.\"\\n\\nIn similar wise, in his smaller works for piano--his impromptus, \"moments\\nmusicals,\" dances, marches, variations, etc.--we see the marked influence\\nof the Lied. The impromptu in G major, Op. 90, for example, is a \"song\\nwithout words.\" In piano music not only Mendelssohn and Schumann, but also\\nChopin, drew copious inspiration from Schubert, who thus stands as one of\\nthe principal founders of the modern imaginative and romantic schools.\\n\\nWe have seen that the Erl King was at first coldly received. It marked\\na new departure in the dramatic treatment of musical themes; the ears\\nof the listeners were not taught to expect such treatment; they were\\ndisturbed by the intensity of passion and bewildered by the boldness\\nof the harmonies. In particular at the superb discord where the child\\ncries that the Erl King is seizing him--where the G flat of the voice\\ncomes against the rushing triplets on F natural in octaves resting upon\\nE flat in the bass--much doubt was expressed, and the worthy Ruzicka\\'s\\ningenuity was somewhat taxed to explain and justify such a combination.\\nBut indeed since the beginning of this century the modern ear has received\\na remarkable education in appreciating the use and beauty of dissonances.\\nSchubert\\'s treatment of the Erl King ballad was at first disapproved\\nby Goethe himself; as he said, \"it did not agree with his view of the\\nsubject.\" But Goethe\\'s opinions on musical matters were of small value;\\nthe range of his appreciativeness was in this direction narrowly limited.\\nHe was fond of the worthy old Zelter, who set to music more than a hundred\\nof his songs. Of these Goethe said \"he could scarcely have believed music\\ncapable of producing such delicious tones.\" Zelter\\'s music was certainly\\nnot without merit, and his setting of the \"Konig im Thule\" is still sung\\nand deservedly admired; but to go from Zelter to Schubert required a\\nsorcery more potent than that which brought Helen of Troy to become the\\nbride of mediæval Faust. At any rate Goethe found it so. Toward the end of\\nhis life, when he heard the Erl King sung with its full dramatic effect by\\nMadame Schroder-Devrient, he acknowledged its power, but it was probably\\nthe superb woman and her style of singing that moved him rather than the\\nmusic. At one time the modest Schubert, at the instigation of some friend,\\nventured to send to the great poet some of the settings of his songs\\naccompanied by a letter tremulous with awe. But Goethe never answered the\\nletter, and apparently took no notice of the music. \"Neither in Goethe\\'s\\nworks,\" says Kreissle, \"nor in his correspondence with Zelter, nor in his\\nconversations with Eckermann, do we find a syllable in connection with\\nSchubert\\'s name.\" Little did either the poet or the musician realize that\\nthroughout all future time their names were to be inseparably associated.\\nIt was the poems of Goethe that inspired Schubert with some of his most\\nbeautiful and sublime conceptions. He set sixty-seven of them to music,\\nand of the whole number there is perhaps not one in which we do not feel\\nthat the song of the greatest of German poets has been invested with a\\nhigher spiritual life by the music of the most poetical composer the world\\nhas seen. How full of the most delicate fragrance of poetry are the lines\\n\"Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh,\" etc.! but when one has once associated them\\nwith Schubert\\'s music, one feels that to break this association (were it\\npossible) and return to the verses pure and simple would be a far greater\\ndescent than from poetry to prose.\\n\\nIn spite of the startling originality already evinced in the Erl King,\\nwe find a decided conservatism alleged for some of Schubert\\'s musical\\njudgments at this youthful period. It was a time when Beethoven was still\\nby many people regarded with suspicion as a reckless innovator upon the\\northodox forms and methods. Since the middle of the century, indeed, one\\nhas often heard some of the magnificent works of Beethoven\\'s third period,\\nincluding his four latest piano sonatas and some of his quartets, set\\ndown as eccentric vagaries instead of being comprehended in their true\\nlight as the ripe fruits of his most consummate artistic maturity. At the\\nbeginning of the century more or less opposition was excited even by the\\nearlier works of Beethoven which transgressed the limits of expression\\nwithin which Haydn and Mozart had been confined. Schubert was at that time\\na friend and to some extent a pupil of the Venetian composer, Antonio\\nSalieri, conductor of the choir in the Emperor\\'s chapel. Salieri gave\\nSchubert more or less instruction in thorough-bass and used to correct\\nand criticise his compositions. He advised him not to waste his time\\nover ballads and lyrics by Goethe and Schiller, but to set to music by\\npreference the old and formal Italian stanzas. Another piece of advice, as\\napplied to the inexhaustible Schubert, is deliciously grotesque; Salieri\\nthought he had better \"husband his resources of melody.\" There is a point\\nof view, as we shall presently see, from which a grain of sound sense can\\nbe descried in such counsel; but these incidents sufficiently indicate\\nSalieri\\'s conservatism of temperament. He wrote about forty operas, a\\ndozen oratorios and cantatas, and a quantity of miscellaneous vocal and\\nand instrumental works, not without merit, all of which have virtually\\nsunk into oblivion. In June 1816 there was a jubilee festival to celebrate\\nSalieri\\'s residence of fifty years in Vienna, and many compositions of\\nhis pupils, written especially for the occasion, were produced. The music\\nended with a chorus from Salieri\\'s oratorio, \"Christ in Hades,\" in\\nwhich the composer had caught some of his inspiration from Gluck. After\\nreturning from the performance, Schubert wrote that same evening in his\\ndiary as follows:--\"It must be pleasant and invigorating to the artist to\\nsee his pupils gathered about him, every one striving to do his best for\\nhis master\\'s jubilee feast; to hear in all their compositions a simple\\nand natural expression, free from all that _bizarrerie_ which prevails\\nwith the majority of composers of our time, and for which we are in the\\nmain indebted to one of our greatest German artists; free, I say, from\\nthat _bizarrerie_ which links the tragic with the comic, the agreeable\\nwith the repulsive, the heroic with the whimpering, the most sacred themes\\nwith buffoonery,--and all without discrimination; so that the hearers are\\ngoaded to frenzy instead of dissolving in love, and tickled into senseless\\nlaughter rather than raised toward heaven. The fact that this miserable\\n_bizarrerie_ has been proscribed and exiled from the circle of his pupils,\\nso that their eyes may rest on pure, holy Nature, must be a source of\\nlively satisfaction to the artist who, with a Gluck for a pioneer,\\nhas learned to know Nature, and has clung to her in spite of the most\\nunnatural influences of our day.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile letter from Schubert, to committee of Austrian\\nMusical Society which accompanied his score of the C-minor symphony.\\nOriginal in possession of the \"Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde\" in Vienna.]\\n\\nNow the person here mentioned as \"one of our greatest German artists\"\\ncan hardly be any other than Beethoven, and the following clauses, in\\nwhich the _bizarrerie_ ascribed to him is defined, give expression to\\nthe stock objections that were urged in those days, by an unintelligent\\npublic and by musicians of narrow vision, against his music. Did the\\nyouthful Schubert mean to echo and approve these shallow criticisms? Sir\\nGeorge Grove seems to think so, and quotes from the same diary a passage,\\ndated three days earlier, in which most intense love and admiration is\\nexpressed for Mozart\\'s music; from which it is inferred that there can\\nbe no doubt to which of the two great masters Schubert was most strongly\\nattached at that time. Kreissle, on the other hand, without offering any\\nexplanation of the passage above quoted, simply comments on it as a series\\nof \"somewhat misty and confused remarks.\"\\n\\nIn those days there was nothing strange in a young musician, even\\nif endowed with vast powers of comprehension, finding Mozart always\\nsatisfactory and Beethoven sometimes unintelligible. That was one of the\\nmusical limitations of that particular moment in the history of music.\\nIf the entry in Schubert\\'s diary is to be taken seriously, it is only\\none among many illustrations of the difficulty which one creative genius\\noften finds in comprehending the methods and results of another creative\\ngenius. But in Schubert\\'s case there is some improbability in such a view.\\nHis early symphonies and string quartets, indeed, show that the influence\\nof Haydn and Mozart was at that time quite masterful with him, while the\\ninfluence of Beethoven was comparatively slight. But he had already spoken\\nof Beethoven in terms of most enthusiastic and reverent admiration; and\\nit is not easy to believe that at the age of nineteen the composer of the\\nErl King could have seriously repeated the crude stock objections that\\nwere urged against the composer of the C-minor symphony by old fossils\\nlike Salieri. The entry in Schubert\\'s diary is redolent of irony, and\\nwas probably intended as a harmless vent for his satirical amusement at\\nthe foibles of the kindly old master who tried to repress his youthful\\nexuberance and advised him not to meddle with German ballads. This kind of\\nhumor without bitterness was eminently characteristic of Schubert.\\n\\nSchubert\\'s one fault was one to which allusion has already been made. As\\nis so often the case, it was closely connected with his chief attribute\\nof strength. His unrivalled spontaneity often led him into diffuseness.\\nMelodies tumbled forth in such lavish profusion as to interfere with the\\nconciseness of his works and mar their artistic form. This is chiefly true\\nof his earlier instrumental works. It is not often the case with his vocal\\nsongs. There his musical creativeness is constrained into perfection of\\nform through his completely adequate poetical conception of the words.\\nFrom the Erl King to \"Am Meer\" his greatest songs are remarkable for\\nsaying just enough and knowing exactly when to stop. It is noticeable that\\nhe very seldom repeats the same verbal phrases, with changes of melody\\nor harmony, as is customary in arias. In the arias, as well as in the\\ngrand choruses, of oratorios, cantatas, and operas, such repetition is\\noften of the highest value as leading to an accumulation of sublime or\\ngorgeous effects hardly otherwise attainable. But inasmuch as it is an\\nartificial means of producing effects and would thus interfere with the\\nsimple spontaneity of the Lied, it would generally be out of place there.\\nWith Schubert the words of the poem are not merely a vehicle for the\\nmelody, but poetry and music are fused into such identity that when one\\nhas once known them it becomes impossible to separate them. In his earlier\\ninstrumental works, however, released from the guidance of the poetical\\nthought expressed in words, Schubert\\'s exuberance of fancy often runs\\naway with him, and takes him into a trackless forest of sweet melodies\\nand rich harmonies from which he finds it difficult to emerge. But in his\\nmore mature works we find him rapidly outgrowing this fault and acquiring\\ncomplete mastery of his resources. In the A-minor sonata, the D-minor\\nquartet, and the last two symphonies, the form is as perfect as the\\nthought; and we are thus again reminded that Schubert, like young Lycidas\\nand others whom the gods have dearly loved, was cut off in his early prime.\\n\\nSo careless of fame was Schubert, so suddenly did death seize him, and so\\nlittle did the world suspect the untold wealth of music written upon musty\\nsheets of paper tucked away in sundry old drawers and cupboards in Vienna,\\nthat much of it has remained unknown until the present day. As from time\\nto time new songs, sonatas, trios, or symphonies were brought to light,\\na witty French journal began to utter doubts of their genuineness and to\\nscoff at the \"posthumous diligence\" of \"the song-writer Schubert.\" This\\nwas in 1839. Schumann was one of the first to bring to light the great\\nmerits of Schubert\\'s genius, as we have seen in the case of his Symphony\\nin C major, and his enthusiasm for Schubert knew no bounds. \"There was a\\ntime,\" he said, \"when it gave me no pleasure to speak of Schubert; I could\\nonly talk of him by night to the trees and stars. Who amongst us, at some\\ntime or another, has not been sentimental? Charmed by his new spirit,\\nwhose capacities seemed to me boundless, deaf to everything that could be\\nurged against him, my thoughts were absorbed in Schubert.\"\\n\\nSince then much more has been done toward collecting and editing these\\nwonderful manuscripts, and the thanks of the whole world of music-lovers\\nare due to Sir George Grove for his devoted persistence in this work.\\nVast as Schubert\\'s fame has come to be, it is probably destined to grow\\nyet greater as his works and his influence are more intimately studied.\\nFew indeed have been the composers who have ever brought us nearer to the\\neternal fountains of divine music.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe original documents for a biographical sketch, excepting the vast mass\\nof manuscript music, are less abundant than with most other musicians of\\nthe highest rank. For this fact several causes may be assigned. Schubert\\nwas as careless of fame as Shakespeare. He was shy of disposition and\\ninclined to withdraw himself from the world\\'s gaze. He was not a virtuoso,\\nand was never called upon, like the youthful Mozart, to play the piano\\nor any other instrument before crowned heads, or in the presence of a\\npublic wild with enthusiasm; nor did he ever come into prominence as a\\ndirector or conductor, like Handel and Mendelssohn. There was thus no\\noccasion for him to make long journeys and become personally known to\\nhis contemporaries. In the course of his short life, except for a little\\ntravelling in rural Styria and Upper Austria, he never went outside of\\nVienna; and there he was not, like Beethoven, thrown habitually into the\\nsociety of aristocratic people; his few companions were for the most part\\nof humble station, though some of them in later years were not unknown\\nto fame. The obscurity of Schubert during his lifetime cannot be better\\nillustrated than by the fact that such a kindred spirit should have lived\\nso many years in the same city with Beethoven--and Vienna was not then\\na large city--before attracting his attention. Nor did Schubert acquire\\ndistinction as a musical critic, like Schumann, or leave behind him\\nwritings characterized by philosophic acuteness or literary charm. He was\\nsimply and purely a composer, the most prolific, all things considered,\\nthat ever lived. He poured forth with incredible rapidity, songs,\\nsymphonies, sonatas, operas, masses, chamber-music, until sudden death\\novertook him. A great deal of this music he never heard himself except in\\nhis innermost soul; much of it still remained in manuscript forty years\\nafter his death; during his life he was known chiefly as a song writer,\\nand in that department his unequalled excellence was recognized by few,\\nwhile it was too soon for any one to comprehend the significance of his\\ncreative work in its relations to the development of modern music. Thus\\nthe reputation of Schubert, more than that of any other composer of like\\neminence, is a posthumous reputation. His existence was too large a fact\\nfor mankind to take in until after he had passed away. These facts account\\nfor the comparative slightness of biographical material in Schubert\\'s\\ncase. There is, nevertheless, material enough to give us an adequate\\npicture of that singularly simple and uneventful life, the details of\\nwhich are largely comprised in the record of the compositions turned off\\none after another with bewildering rapidity.\\n\\nAmong biographical sources the first place belongs to the sketch \"Aus\\nFranz Schubert\\'s Leben,\" by his brother Ferdinand Schubert. It was\\npublished in Schumann\\'s \"Neues Zeitschrift fur Musik,\" 1839, numbers\\n33-36, and is so good as to make one wish there were much more of it.\\nBetween 1829 and 1880 personal reminiscences of Schubert were published\\nby Mayrhofer, Bauernfeld, Schindler, Sofie Muller, and Ferdinand Hiller,\\nbibliographical notes of which are given in Grove\\'s \"Dictionary of Music,\"\\nVol. III. p. 370. The first attempt at a thorough biography was the book\\nof Kreissle von Hellborn, \"Franz Schubert,\" of which the second edition,\\npublished at Vienna in 1865, is an octavo of 619 pages. Though dull and\\nverbose in style, and quite without literary merit, its fullness and\\ngeneral accuracy of information make it a very valuable work. An English\\ntranslation by Mr. Arthur Duke Coleridge was published by Longmans, Green\\n& Co., in 1869, in 2 vols. 8vo, with an appendix by Grove, containing\\nthe results of researches made among Schubert manuscripts in Vienna in\\n1867. Much slighter works are the biographies by Reissmann (Berlin,\\n1873), Higgli (Leipsic, 1880), Frost (London, 1881), and the article in\\nWurzbach\\'s \"Biographisches Lexicon\" (Vienna, 1876). The article by Sir\\nGeorge Grove, in his \"Dictionary of Music\" (London, 1883), for critical\\naccuracy and thoroughness of information leaves little to be desired.\\nThere are also many excellent and profoundly appreciative notices of\\nSchubert and his works scattered through Schumann\\'s \"Gesammelte Schriften\\nuber Musik und Musiker,\" 2? Aufl., Leipz., 1871. From the sources thus\\nenumerated, as well as from a long study of Schubert\\'s songs and piano\\nmusic and an acquaintance more or less extensive with his other works, the\\nforegoing sketch has been prepared.\\n\\n[Illustration: John Fisher.]\\n\\n[Illustration: Erl King.

His father, a physician, and his mother both\\nhad musical inclinations, the former being a flute player and the latter\\na pianist and singer. They left Brunswick when Ludwig was two years old\\nand went to Seesen, where the early childhood of the future composer was\\npassed. The boy\\'s musical gifts made themselves known early in life and\\nhe sang with his mother when he was only four years old. According to\\nhis own story in his autobiography, he began to play the violin without\\ninstruction at the age of five. He must have shown some talent, for he was\\nturned over to Herr Riemenschneider for instruction. In a short time he\\nwas allowed to practise music with the family in the evenings and with his\\nparents performed trios by Kalkbrenner for violin, flute and piano.\\n\\nAbout the year 1790 or 1791, Dufour, a French violinist, arrived at Seesen\\nand the boy, having heard him play, did not rest until he became the\\nFrenchman\\'s pupil. Dufour perceived the child\\'s great gifts and persuaded\\nDr. Spohr to abandon the idea of educating his boy in medicine, and to\\ndecide to make a musician of him. While studying with Dufour, Spohr made\\nhis first crude attempts at composition, even beginning an opera, which,\\nhowever, went no further than an overture, a chorus and an aria. Dufour\\nadvised that the child be sent to Brunswick to continue his studies.\\nAt Brunswick he lived in the house of one Michaelis, a rich baker, and\\nstudied the violin under Kunisch, of the Ducal orchestra, and counterpoint\\nunder Hartung, an old organist. Hartung was very severe with his young\\npupil and scratched out so much that the boy felt that none of his ideas\\nwere left. However, the ill health of the organist brought the lessons to\\nan end in a few months, and this was all the instruction in theory that\\nSpohr ever received. He now continued his studies by reading scores,\\nwhich Kunisch obtained for him from the theatre library. He made such\\nprogress that he appeared at one of the concerts of the Catherine School\\nwith a violin composition of his own. His success was such that he was\\ninvited to play at the subscription concerts of the Deutsche Haus and was\\nallowed to play for practice in the theatre orchestra, where he became\\nacquainted with much good music.\\n\\nHe was now, by the advice of Kunisch, put under the instruction of\\nMaucourt, the leading violinist of Brunswick. A year later the young\\nviolinist set out for Hamburg with a few letters of introduction and\\na determination to appear as an artist. He failed, however, to get a\\nhearing, and his money being exhausted, he set out on foot to return to\\nBrunswick. In his despair he determined to make a personal appeal to the\\nDuke of Brunswick, to whom he drew up a petition and presented it when\\nhe met the nobleman, walking in his park. The Duke asked who had worded\\nthe petition. \"Well, who but I myself?\" answered Spohr; \"I need no help\\nfor that.\" The Duke said: \"Come to the palace tomorrow at eleven; we\\nwill then speak further about your request.\" Upon which the boy departed\\nquite happy. The Duke questioned Maucourt about Spohr\\'s ability, and when\\nthe lad called the next day told him that he was to play one of his own\\ncompositions at the next concert in the apartments of the Duchess. His\\nperformance so pleased the Duke that the nobleman promised him instruction\\nunder competent masters and appointed him chamber musician, Aug. 2, 1799.\\nSpohr\\'s salary was small, but it made him independent, and enabled him to\\ntake his younger brother, Ferdinand, to live with him.\\n\\nAt first the young chamber musician heard a good deal of French music,\\nbut an operatic company from Magdeburg introduced him to Mozart\\'s music,\\nand he says in his autobiography, \"Mozart now became for my lifetime\\nmy ideal and model.\" He spent whole nights studying the scores of \"Don\\nGiovanni\" and \"Die Zauberflote.\" Now, too, he played chamber music and\\nfirst learned Beethoven\\'s quartets. Finally the Duke asked him to select\\na teacher among the great violinists of the day. He at once named Viotti,\\nbut he had given up music for the business of selling wine. Ferdinand Eck\\nwas the next choice, but he declined to receive pupils. Francis Eck, his\\nyounger brother, accepted the Duke\\'s offer and Spohr was sent with him to\\nSt. Petersburg, where he had engagements to fill. They left Brunswick on\\nApril 24, 1802. Owing to Eck\\'s engagements his instruction of Spohr was\\nirregular, but the boy gained much instruction from constantly hearing\\nhim. The young violinist was very industrious, often practising ten hours\\na day, composing considerably, and painting for recreation. While on this\\ntour he wrote his first published violin concertos, Opus 1, A minor, and\\nOpus 2, D minor, and the \"Duos Concertants\" for two violins, Opus 3.\\nIn St. Petersburg he met Clementi, Field and many minor musicians, and\\nplayed frequently in chamber-music rehearsals. He also wrote in 1803 for\\nBreitkopf and Hartel, the eminent Leipsic publishers, an article on the\\nstate of music in Russia. He returned to Brunswick in the summer of that\\nyear and heard Rode for the first time. He gave a public concert which\\npleased the Duke and resumed his duties as a member of the orchestra.\\n\\nIn 1804 he started for Paris with his fine Guarnerius violin, given him by\\nRemi, a Russian violinist. Just outside of Gottingen it was stolen from\\nthe carriage. Spohr returned to Brunswick and with the Duke\\'s help got\\nanother violin. Then he made a tour, playing in several German cities,\\nincluding Leipsic, Dresden and Berlin, in the last place having the\\nassistance of Meyerbeer, then a clever pianist thirteen years old. In\\n1805 Spohr became leader of the Duke of Gotha\\'s band. He married Dorette\\nSchneidler, a harp-player, and wrote for her and himself some compositions\\nfor harp and violin. He wrote his first opera, \"Die Prufung,\" which\\nreached a concert performance. With his wife in 1807 he visited Leipsic,\\nDresden, Munich, Prague, Stuttgart, Heidelberg and Frankfort. His second\\nopera \"Alruna\" was written in 1808, but it was never performed, though\\naccepted at Weimar. In this year Spohr went to Erfurt to see Napoleon\\'s\\ncongress of princes, but found that ordinary human beings like himself\\ncould not enter the theatre which they attended in the evenings. He\\npersuaded the second horn player in the orchestra to allow him to take his\\nplace and practised on the horn all day. In the evening, being forbidden\\nto stare at the august audience, he viewed the assembled potentates in a\\nsmall mirror which he had taken with him for that purpose.\\n\\nThe year 1809 is important in Spohr\\'s history for two reasons. While\\nmaking a tour he received at Hamburg a commission for an opera, \"The\\nLovers\\' Duel,\" and at Frankenhausen in Thuringia he conducted the first\\nmusic festival in Germany. For the second of those festivals in 1811\\nhe wrote his first symphony in E flat. The opera was also finished in\\nthe winter of 1810-1811. His first oratorio, \"Das jungste Gericht,\" was\\nwritten for the Fete Napoleon at Erfurt and produced there Aug. 15, 1812.\\nIt was in the composition of this work that he found himself hampered by\\nhis lack of skill in counterpoint. He bought Marpurg\\'s work and studied\\nit. But Spohr was dissatisfied with his opera and with his oratorio. He\\nfelt that he was too much under the dominance of Mozart, and resolved to\\nfree himself from that master\\'s influence. He says in his autobiography\\nthat in \"Faust\" he was careful to avoid imitating Mozart.\\n\\nIn 1812 he made his debut at Vienna as violinist and composer with such\\nsuccess that the leadership of the orchestra at the Theatre an der Wien\\nwas offered to him. The conditions were very favorable, so he gave up his\\nposition at Gotha and betook himself to the Austrian capital. There his\\nduties were burdensome, but he was in the musical centre of Europe. He met\\nBeethoven, and was on terms of friendship with that great master, whose\\ngenius, however, he did not fully appreciate. Among his treasures when he\\nleft Vienna was a canon for three voices on some words from Schiller\\'s\\n\"Maid of Orleans\" written for him by Beethoven. Spohr\\'s \"Autobiography\"\\ncontains some interesting anecdotes about Beethoven\\'s conducting.\\n\\nSpohr\\'s Viennese sojourn was successful, but on account of disagreements\\nwith the manager of the theatre he left the city in 1815, and made a\\nvisit to Prince Carolath in Bohemia. His next musical undertaking was the\\nconduct of another festival at Frankhausen. His cantata, \"Das befreite\\nDeutschland,\" was there produced. He afterward went on a tour through\\nGermany, Switzerland and Italy, and his eighth violin concerto (\"Scena\\nCantante\") was written to please the public of the last-named country. In\\nItaly he met Rossini, whom he never admired as a composer. He also met\\nPaganini, who treated him with much courtesy.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of letter from Spohr deploring the death of his\\nwife, in 1834.]\\n\\nIn 1817 he returned to Germany. While travelling and giving concerts with\\nhis wife, he received an offer from Mr. Ihlee, director of the theatre\\nat Frankfort, to become conductor of the opera there. He accepted the\\noffer and at once set out for his new post. One of his first acts was to\\nobtain the consent of the managers to the production of his opera \"Faust\"\\nwhich he had written in Vienna five years before. He says, \"At first, it\\nis true, it pleased the great majority less than the connoisseurs, but\\nwith each representation gained more admirers.\" His success encouraged\\nhim to new dramatic attempts, and he set to work on an operatic version\\nof Appel\\'s \"Der schwarze Jager\" (The Black Huntsman). He soon learned,\\nhowever, that Weber was at work on the same subject, and he abandoned his\\nopera. While looking for a new libretto he wrote the three quartets, Opus\\n45. In September, 1818, he began work on his \"Zemire und Azor,\" of which\\nthe text had been previously used by Gretry in his \"La Belle et la Bete.\"\\nDisagreements with the managers of the Frankfort theatre caused him to\\nresign his post there in September, 1819.\\n\\nIn 1820 he visited England at the invitation of the Philharmonic Society\\nof London. His debut was made at the opening concert of the season, March\\nsixth, when he played with much success his Concerto No. 8. At the next\\nconcert he was to have appeared as leader. \"It was at that time still\\nthe custom there,\" he says in his autobiography, \"that when symphonies\\nand overtures were performed, the pianist had the score before him, not\\nexactly to conduct from it, but only to read after and to play in with the\\norchestra at pleasure, which when it was heard, had a very bad effect.\\nThe real conductor was the first violin, who gave the tempi, and now and\\nthen when the orchestra began to falter, gave the beat with the bow of his\\nviolin.\" Spohr induced Ries, the pianist, to let him make an experiment,\\nand he conducted, after overcoming the opposition of the directors, with\\na baton, for the first time at one of these concerts. The success of the\\nnew method was so great that the old way went out forever. His symphony\\nin D minor was produced at this concert, and at the last concert of the\\nseason another of his symphonies was heard for the first time in England.\\nAt his last concert, his wife, who had been since her arrival in England\\nbusily engaged in mastering the Erard double action harp (she had before\\nplayed the single action instrument), appeared and was much applauded. Her\\nhealth subsequently failed, and she died in 1834. Spohr married a second\\ntime in 1836. His second wife was Marianne Pfeiffer, the elder of the two\\ndaughters of the Chief Councillor of Cassel. She was a good pianist and\\nplayed together with Spohr with considerable success. She died Jan. 4,\\n1892.\\n\\nSpohr visited Paris for the first time on his way home from England.\\nIn the French capital he made the acquaintance of Kreutzer, Cherubini,\\nHabeneck and other eminent musicians, all of whom received him with\\ncourteous consideration and showed a warm interest in his music. He gave a\\nconcert at the Opera with satisfying success. Cherubini was particularly\\npleased with his work, and Spohr tells with pride how the old martinet of\\nthe Conservatoire made him play one of his quartets three times. Spohr\\nreturned to Germany and took up his residence in the artistic city of\\nDresden, where he found Weber engaged in producing \"Der Freischutz,\"\\nalready a pronounced success in Vienna and Berlin. Weber was offered the\\npost of Hof-Kapellmeister by the Elector of Cassel, but he declined it\\nbecause he did not wish to leave Dresden. He warmly recommended Spohr,\\nwho received the appointment, accepted it, and on Jan. 1, 1822, entered\\nupon his duties in the city which was to be his home for the rest of his\\nlife. The first new work studied there under his direction was his own\\n\"Zemire und Azor,\" which was produced on March 24, and repeated several\\ntimes in the course of the year. His family arrived at Cassel in March,\\nand he settled down in the domestic circle and began the composition of\\n\"Jessonda,\" which he finished in December, 1822. In a letter written in\\nJanuary, 1823, he says: \"I have been latterly so much engaged upon a new\\nopera that I have somewhat neglected everything else. It is now ready, and\\nI am right glad to have completed so important a work. If I expect more\\nfrom this opera than from the earlier ones, it is because of my greater\\nexperience, and the inspiration I felt in the study of almost every number\\nof the successfully written libretto.\" The opera was produced on the\\nbirthday of the Elector, July 28, 1823, and was at once successful. Spohr\\nwrites (Aug. 2, 1823): \"This work has made me very happy, and I have\\nreason to hope that the opera will please much in other places.\"\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nReproduced from a lithograph portrait drawn by W. Pfaff.]\\n\\n[Music: Sextett\\n\\nLouis Spohr]\\n\\nAt this time Spohr continued the composition of chamber music and formed\\na quartet, consisting of himself, Wiele, solo violinist of the court\\norchestra, Ferdinand Spohr, viola, and Haseman, \\'cello. About this time,\\ntoo, he wrote the first of his four double quartets, which were then a\\ngreat novelty. He visited Leipsic and Berlin to conduct first performances\\nof \"Jessonda,\" which in both cities achieved great success. In 1824, he\\nenjoyed the society of Mendelssohn during the winter in Berlin. Returning\\nto Cassel he wrote his opera \"Der Berggeist,\" which was produced at the\\nmarriage of the Elector\\'s daughter on Mar. 23, 1825, and was well received.\\n\\nIn the same year Rochlitz, editor of the Leipsic _Music Journal_, offered\\nhim the text of the oratorio, \"The Last Judgment,\" and he set to work on\\nit at once. The oratorio was produced in the Lutheran church of Cassel,\\non Good Friday, Mar. 25, 1826, and made a deep impression. In 1827, he\\nproduced another opera, \"Pietro von Albano,\" which in spite of Meyerbeer\\'s\\nenthusiastic praise, had little success. In 1831, he finished his \"Violin\\nSchool,\" a book of instruction which is still held in esteem though not\\nregarded as the best. In 1832, political disturbances, in which Spohr\\nplayed the radical and offended the Elector, interrupted the opera\\nperformances at Cassel for a long time, and the artist devoted his time\\nto oratorio and instrumental composition. In 1832 he wrote his most noted\\nsymphony, \"The Consecration of Tones,\" and in 1834 he was at work on his\\n\"Calvary,\" which was produced at Cassel on Good Friday, 1835. He went\\nto England a second time in 1839, to conduct \"Calvary\" at the Norwich\\nFestival. The success of the work was so great that he was commissioned to\\nwrite \"The Fall of Babylon\" (the book by Edward Taylor) for the Norwich\\nFestival of 1842. In 1840 he conducted a festival at Aix-la-Chapelle, and\\nin 1842 he produced Wagner\\'s \"Der Fliegende Hollander\" at Cassel.\\n\\nHe had heard much in its praise from Dresden, and having read the work was\\nat once pleased with it. In writing to a friend he said: \"It interests\\nme, nevertheless, in the highest degree, for it is written apparently\\nwith true inspiration--and unlike so much of the modern opera music,\\ndoes not display in every bar the striving after effect, or effort to\\nplease. There is a great deal of the fanciful there-in; a noble conception\\nthroughout; it is well-written for the singer; enormously difficult, it\\nis true, and somewhat overcharged in the instrumentation, but full of new\\neffects, and will assuredly, when it once comes to be performed in the\\ngreater space of the theatre, be thoroughly clear, and intelligible....\\nI think I am so far correct in my judgment, when I consider Wagner as\\nthe most gifted of all our dramatic composers of the present time.\" This\\nopinion of Spohr\\'s is creditable to his judgment as a musician and his\\ngenerosity as a man. He worked hard and gave a performance which pleased\\nthe public. He wrote to Wagner of the success of his work and received\\nfrom the young composer one of his characteristic letters of gratitude.\\n\\nThe Elector of Hesse-Cassel, unmoved even by a monster petition headed\\nwith the name of Lord Aberdeen, declined to permit Spohr to go to England,\\nand conduct the \"Fall of Babylon\" at the Norwich Festival. The oratorio\\nwas produced without his assistance and was highly successful. He went\\nto England, however, at the beginning of his summer vacation and gave\\nsome profitable concerts. In 1844 he brought forward his last opera, \"Die\\nKreuzfahrer\" (\"The Crusaders\"). For this he had arranged his own libretto\\nfrom a play by Kotzebue. The success of the opera, performed at Cassel\\nand Berlin, was brief. He made a trip to Paris, where the Conservatoire\\norchestra honored him with a special performance of his \"Consecration of\\nTones.\" He conducted the \"Missa Solemnis\" and the Ninth Symphony at the\\nBeethoven Festival at Bonn, in the same year. In 1847 he again visited\\nLondon, when his \"Fall of Babylon,\" \"Last Judgment,\" \"Lord\\'s Prayer,\"\\nand Milton\\'s eighty-fourth psalm were presented in three concerts by the\\nSacred Harmonic Society. In the same year the twenty-fifth anniversary\\nof his assumption of the directorship at Cassel was celebrated by a\\nperformance of excerpts from his operas.\\n\\nThe revolutionary events of 1848 interrupted Spohr\\'s flow of compositions.\\nHe felt, as he wrote to his friend Hauptmann, that \"the excitement of\\npolitics and the constant reading of newspapers incapacitated him from\\ngiving his attention to any serious and quiet study.\" In 1849, while\\nrecovering from an illness caused by a fall on the ice, he planned his\\nninth symphony, \"The Seasons,\" which he wrote shortly after his recovery.\\nHe went to Breslau in the hope of hearing Schumann\\'s \"Genoveva,\" but\\nowing to delays heard only some rehearsals. During his two weeks\\' stay in\\nBreslau, honors were heaped upon him. Banquets were given, concerts of his\\nmusic were arranged, and his opera \"Zemire und Azor\" was performed at the\\ntheatre. In 1850 he was made to suffer from court malice. The Elector,\\nprobably to chastise him for his radical political ideas, refused him\\npermission to take a summer vacation. He went away without leave, and the\\nresult was a lawsuit with the managers of the theatre, which after four\\nyears he lost by a technicality.\\n\\nIn 1852, at the invitation of the Covent Garden management, he again\\nvisited England to produce his \"Faust,\" which was successfully given on\\nJuly 15 with Castellan, Ronconi, Formes and Tamberlik in the principal\\nparts. In 1853 Spohr showed once more his respect and consideration\\nfor the rising genius of Wagner by devoting his energies to a careful\\nproduction of \"Tannhauser.\" The letters of Spohr show that while he\\nheartily sympathized with Wagner\\'s irresistible sincerity of purpose\\nand the honesty of his dramatic art, he, like many others, found the\\nnew master\\'s manner of writing hard to comprehend. He exclaims in one\\nletter to Hauptmann: \"What faces would Haydn and Mozart make, were they\\nobliged to hear the stunning noise that is now given to us for music.\"\\nNevertheless Spohr saw the germs of a noble dramatic style in these works\\nof Wagner, and after his successful and artistically admirable production\\nof \"Tannhauser,\" he turned his attention to \"Lohengrin.\" Owing, however,\\nto the opposition of the Elector and the court, the work was not produced,\\nand, indeed, Spohr never heard it. In the same year (1853) he made his\\nsixth visit to London, conducting three concerts of the New Philharmonic\\nSociety, at which, among other things, his own double symphony and\\nBeethoven\\'s ninth were performed. His opera \"Jessonda\" was put in\\nrehearsal at Covent Garden by Mr. Gye, but Spohr had to return to Cassel\\nbefore it was produced.\\n\\nOn his return journey he planned his septet for piano, two stringed and\\nfour wind instruments, one of his most admired chamber compositions. In\\n1854 he passed his summer vacation in Switzerland and visited Munich.\\nIn 1855 he visited Hanover, where he heard his seventh violin concerto\\nplayed, as he writes, \"in a very masterly manner, by Joachim.\" On his\\ndeparture from Hanover the Royal Hanoverian Chapel presented him with\\na very handsome conductor\\'s baton. In 1856 Spohr became conscious\\nthat his productive powers were failing. He wrote two quartets and a\\nsymphony, all three of which he condemned, after repeated alterations,\\nto remain in manuscript and silence. In 1857 he made a trip through\\nHolland and returned to Cassel much refreshed. On Nov. 14, much against\\nhis inclination, the elector retired him from active duty on a pension\\nof fifteen hundred thalers per annum. He soon became reconciled to his\\nretirement, but two days after Christmas he met with a more serious\\nmisfortune in a fall which broke his left arm and rendered him incapable\\nof further violin playing. This was a source of deep grief to him and\\nno doubt prepared his spirit for the final resignation of all earthly\\njoys. How he clung to his artistic endeavors may be seen in a letter to\\nHauptmann (April 6, 1858) in which he says: \"I am now perfectly convinced\\nthat I cannot accomplish any great work more. I regret to say that my\\nlast attempt of the kind failed, and my requiem remains a fragment;\\nnevertheless, as the subject, as far as the _Lachrimosa dies illa_, at\\nwhich I stuck fast, pleases me well, and seems to have much that is new\\nand ingenious in it, I shall not destroy it, as I should like to take\\nit up again, and shall make another attempt to complete it.\" He devoted\\nhalf a day to this attempt, but the effort only brought him to a final\\ndetermination to abandon composition for good and all.\\n\\nIn the beginning of July he went to Prague, when the 50th anniversary of\\nthe Conservatory was celebrated by three musical performances, one being\\nof \"Jessonda.\" On the way home he visited Alexandersbad, returning much\\nrefreshed. Yet thenceforward his spirits declined; he complained to his\\nwife that he was weary of life because he could no longer do anything. In\\nSeptember, however, he summoned enough interest to go to the Middle-Rhine\\nFestival at Wiesbaden and in October to Leipsic. In December, 1858, he\\noccupied himself once more as a teacher, giving lessons gratis to a poor\\ngirl who wished to become a teacher. On April 12, 1859, he made his last\\nappearance as a conductor, directing his own \"Consecration of Tones\"\\nsymphony at a charitable concert by the Meiningen court orchestra. In the\\ncourse of the summer he made a few short journeys, but could not conceal\\nfrom himself their evil effects. On Sunday, Oct. 16, a change in his\\ncondition became manifest. On retiring that night he expressed to his\\nwife a hope that he should \"at length have a good night\\'s rest.\" In the\\nmorning he awoke calm and refreshed in spirit, but his physician at once\\nsaw that the end was at hand. He lingered, surrounded by those he loved,\\ntill Oct. 22, when at 10.30 in the evening he peacefully passed away. In\\n1883 a statue was erected to his memory.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSpohr\\'s principal works are as follows: oratorios and cantatas--\"Das\\njungste Gericht\" (\"The Last Judgment,\" first version, 1812), \"Die Letzten\\nDinge\" (\"The Last Judgment,\" second version, 1826), \"Des Heilands letzte\\nStunden\" (\"Calvary,\" 1835), \"Der Fall Babylons\" (\"The Fall of Babylon,\"\\n1841), and \"Das befreite Deutschland\" (\"Free Germany\"), MS.; operas--\"Die\\nPrufung\" (\"The Trial,\" 1806), \"Alruna\" (1808), \"Die Eulenkonigin\" (\"The\\nOwl Queen,\" 1808), \"Die Zweikampf mit der Geliebten\" (\"The Lovers\\' Duel,\"\\n1811), \"Faust\" (1818), \"Zemire und Azor\" (1819), \"Jessonda\" (1823), \"Der\\nBerggeist\" (\"The Mountain Spirit,\" 1825), \"Pietro von Albano\" (1827),\\n\"Der Alchymist\" (\"The Alchemist,\" 1830), and \"Die Kreuzfahrer\" (\"The\\nCrusaders,\" 1845); church music--mass for five solo voices and two\\nfive-part choruses, opus 54: three psalms for double chorus and soli, opus\\n85; hymn, \"Gott du bist gross\" (\"God thou art great\"), for chorus, soli\\nand orchestra; symphonies--No. 1, E flat, opus 20; No. 2, D minor, opus\\n49; No. 3, C minor, opus 78; No. 4, \"Consecration of Tones,\" F, opus 86;\\nNo. 5, C minor, opus 102; No. 6, \"Historical symphony,\" G, opus 116; No.\\n7, \"The Earthly and Heavenly in Men\\'s Lives,\" for two orchestras, C, opus\\n121; No. 8, G minor, opus 137; No. 9, \"The Seasons,\" B minor, opus 143;\\neight overtures, 17 violin concertos and concertinas, 15 violin duets, 33\\nstring quartets, 8 quintets, four double quartets, 5 pianoforte trios, 2\\nsextets, an octet and a nonet, and many songs. Schletterer\\'s catalogue of\\nhis works (published by Breitkopf and Hartel) carries the opus numbers\\nup to 154, many of the _opera_ embracing six compositions, and there are\\na dozen compositions without opus numbers, among which are some of his\\noperas and oratorios. In all he left over two hundred works, in all fields\\nof composition.\\n\\nIt is difficult for us at this day to fairly estimate the importance\\nof Spohr as a figure in musical history. Dates show us that his finest\\nworks chanced to see the light about the same time as the over-shadowing\\nmasterpieces of Weber and Mendelssohn. Thus \"Faust\" produced in 1818, was\\neclipsed by \"Der Freischutz,\" in 1821, and his \"Calvary\" (1835) by \"St.\\nPaul\" (1836). His \"Last Judgment\" alone had a free field for a time. But\\nthough we with over half a century\\'s perspective find the masterworks\\nof Weber and Mendelssohn still in the foreground, while Spohr recedes\\ninto the middle distance, the contemporaries of these composers saw them\\nstanding apparently shoulder to shoulder at the front of the picture.\\nSpohr\\'s influence upon those who lived when he did was very considerable,\\nand, more than that, there are certain features of his style, which,\\nit cannot be doubted, presented themselves as attractive models to his\\nimmediate followers along the path of musical progress.\\n\\nBelieving himself to be a disciple of Mozart, and striving to preserve\\nin his writings the suave beauty and sculpturesque repose of the Mozart\\nstyle, Spohr was at heart a romanticist, was in the vanguard of the\\nnew romantic movement in Germany, and established in his compositions\\nsome of those peculiarities which have come to be regarded as special\\ncharacteristics of romantic utterance. While, therefore, he created no\\nschool and, except in violin playing, has had no large following, he\\nexercised over his younger contemporaries a discernible influence, which\\ncannot be disregarded. That no one in our time looks to the works of Spohr\\nfor models, does not obliterate the fact that he was an influential factor\\nin the development of that romantic school which has given us all that is\\ngreatest in music since the death of Beethoven. One critic has well said\\nof him: \"Spohr\\'s noble sentimentality and warmth of expression excited\\nduring his lifetime all the youth of Germany into an unusual enthusiasm.\\nThe composer\\'s influence is now somewhat less than it was, and indeed\\nlatterly his productions have been underrated, but as all that is genuine\\nresists momentary bias, Spohr\\'s works are once again coming to the fore.\\nIn history, Spohr stands as a most important link between the old and\\nnew romantic schools of German tonal art. As a tone-poet he possesses an\\nindividuality so strongly marked, and so important an idiosyncrasy, that\\nhe cannot like Marschner, Kreutzer, Reissiger, and others, be identified\\nwith the school of Weber, but stands almost independent between the\\nlast-named master and men like Mendelssohn and Schumann.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of Introduction to Spohr\\'s fourth Double\\nQuartette in G minor. Original in possession of the Musical Library at\\nDresden.]\\n\\nThe special feature of his style, which the critic just quoted calls an\\n\"important idiosyncrasy,\" was his mastery of chromatic modulations. The\\nuse of chromatic harmonies is characteristic of the romantic school, its\\nfurther development being seen in the \"Tristan und Isolde\" of Wagner.\\nIt may be well to add, for the further enlightenment of the lay reader,\\nthat chromatic modulation is the secret of that flexibility of style and\\nlargeness of tonal atmosphere which are found in Wagner\\'s works; and for\\nthe first determined movement in this direction we must thank Spohr.\\nNevertheless, Spohr\\'s use of chromatic modulations was wholly unlike\\nthat of later composers. As Emil Naumann says, \"If Salieri is justified\\nin saying of certain composers, who use venturesome skips in their\\nmodulations, that they are like a man who jumps through the window when\\nthe door is open, we may well say of Spohr that he passes the open door\\nat least six times before he decides upon entering.\" This circumlocution\\nis unquestionably the result of Spohr\\'s endeavor to place upon his\\nnatural impulses the curb of the Mozartean polish. The outcome of his\\nself-restraint is the reduction of his operas to a dead level of sweetness\\nthat becomes wearisome.\\n\\nIt was this never-ceasing mellifluous quality that forced itself upon\\nthe attention of Chorley and made even that eminent lover of Bellini\\ncry for something else besides candy. Says Chorley: \"The most graceful\\nItalian garden, where \\'grove nods to grove--each alley has its brother,\\'\\nis not arranged with a more perpetual reference to reflexion, parallel,\\nreply, repetition, than the largest or the least piece of handiwork put\\nforth by this arithmetically orderly composer. Further, Dr. Spohr\\'s\\nvocal ideas and phrases have, for the most part, a certain suavity and\\nflow, belonging to the good school of graceful cantabile, eminently\\ncommendable, when not indisputably charming. But it is difficult, nay,\\nI may say at once, impossible, to cite any motive from his pen, which,\\nby its artless vivacity, seizes and retains the ear; and there are few\\nof his melodies that do not recall better tunes by better men.\" This\\nsweet level of cantilena undoubtedly also impressed itself on Schumann,\\nwho was expressing his admiration of Spohr when he said: \"As he looks at\\neverything as though through tears, his figures run into each other like\\nformless, etherial shapes, for which we can scarcely find a name.\"\\n\\nIn fine Spohr\\'s works reveal to us a man who was deficient in personal\\nforce because he was not a creative genius, but who exerted all the\\ninfluence of an original mind upon his contemporaries because he was\\nwholly at heart and almost wholly in practice in touch with a movement\\nnew and absorbing. If Spohr had possessed real creative genius, his\\ndevotion to Mozart as a model would have dwindled before the incitements\\nof the movement toward national romanticism which was agitating German\\nliterature and art. His yearning toward the freedom and infinite\\npossibilities of chromatic harmonies brought him into direct conflict with\\nthe polished symmetry, the veneration for a set form and a conventional\\ndistribution of keys, of the classic period of Mozart. Had he been a man\\nof aggressive individuality he would not have made the mistake of putting\\nan intellectual curb on his emotional impulses, but would have spoken\\naccording to the promptings of his heart.\\n\\nBut Spohr, though earnest in his purposes and intolerant of all that was\\nnot sincere in art, was altogether of too amiable a nature to rudely cross\\nthe Rubicon and seize upon the new territory. He was among those who saw\\nthe promised land, who felt the embrace of its atmosphere, and who yet\\nhesitated upon the borders. The trumpet call of modern romanticism was\\nsounded in 1821 when Vogl made Schubert\\'s \"Erl King\" known to Germany,\\nand in the same year Weber thrilled the hearts of his countrymen by\\ngiving them a national opera, \"Der Freischutz,\" whose story, like that\\nof Schubert\\'s song, was taken from the folk-lore of the people. Spohr\\nfollowed these leaders in making use of the national literatures as in\\n\"Faust,\" and the tales of the fireside, as in \"Zemire und Azor\"; but he\\nemasculated his music in his endeavor to cling to the style of a period\\nwhich had terminated. What might have been a style leading directly into\\nthe restless eloquence of the Wagnerian diction became a \"lingering\\nsweetness, long drawn out,\" and it was reserved for Weber, who had the\\nnecessary force, the resistless energy of creative power, to become the\\nfounder of true German opera and the artistic progenitor of Richard Wagner.\\n\\nWagner showed a warm appreciation of Spohr. He expressed his admiration\\nfor the composer in a letter to a Dresden friend written from Paris, in\\n1860, when he was preparing to produce \"Tannhauser\" in the French capital.\\nHe wrote thus: \"Almost simultaneously I lost by death two venerable men\\nmost worthy of respect. The death of one came home to the whole musical\\nworld, which deplores the loss of Ludwig Spohr. I leave it to that world\\nto estimate what wealth of power, how noble a productiveness departed\\nwith the master\\'s death. To me it is a painful reminder that with him\\ndeparted the last of that company of noble, earnest musicians whose youth\\nwas directly illuminated by the glowing sun of Mozart and who like vestals\\nfed the flame received from him with touching fidelity and protected it\\nagainst all storms and winds on their chaste hearths. This lovely office\\npreserved the man pure and noble; and if I were to undertake to express\\nin a single phrase what Spohr proclaimed to me with such ineradicable\\nimpressiveness, I would say: He was an earnest, upright master of his\\nart. The \\'handle\\' of his life was faith in his art; and his greatest\\nrefreshment flowed from the potency of this belief. And this earnest faith\\nemancipated him from all personal pettiness. All that was entirely foreign\\nto him he severely let alone without attacking it or persecuting it. This\\nwas the coldness and brusqueness with which he was so often charged. That\\nwhich was comprehensible to him (and the composer of \\'Jessonda\\' may be\\ncredited with a deep, fine feeling for everything beautiful), that he\\nloved and cherished, without circumlocution and with zeal, so soon as he\\nrecognized one thing in it--seriousness, a serious intention toward art.\\nHerein lay the bond which attached him in his old age to the new endeavors\\nin art. He could remain a stranger to it, but not an enemy. Honor to our\\nSpohr; venerate his memory! Let us imitate his example.\"\\n\\nAnother feature of Spohr\\'s music which calls for mention is his\\npredilection for a programme. He was a believer in the ability of the\\ncomposer to convey his emotions through the medium of absolute music\\nto the hearer. His \"Consecration of Tones\" symphony, for instance, is\\nan attempt to depict in music the part which music plays in life and\\nnature--an attempt not wholly successful. But these labors give Spohr a\\nplace among the founders of modern romantic writing for orchestra, and\\nas such he must be respected. His chamber music is distinguished by the\\ngeneral characteristics of his style, and by a beautiful clearness of\\nconstruction.\\n\\nAs a composer of violin music and as a performer on the instrument Spohr\\nexercised influence which is still felt. His pupils were Hubert Ries, St.\\nLubin, David, Bott, Blagrove, Kompel and C. L. Bargheer, all players of\\nnote. David was the teacher of Wilhelmj, whose Doric style preserved all\\nforcible simplicity and repose of the Spohr manner. Spohr\\'s playing was\\nbased on the solid principles of the Mannheim school, modified somewhat\\nby the style of Rode, for whom Spohr had a great and well-grounded\\nadmiration. But, as we should expect, Spohr in his maturity arrived\\nat the possession of a style which was wholly the product of his own\\nindividuality. The fundamental and vital characteristic of his playing was\\nhis treatment of the violin as a singing voice. He played with immense\\nbreadth and purity of tone, with subtle delicacy of touch, and with\\nexquisite refinement of phrasing. He had no taste for the free style of\\nbowing cultivated by Paganini and was opposed to anything approaching the\\n_saltato_. He had a large hand and was thus enabled to execute difficult\\npassages of double stopping with accuracy.\\n\\nViolin technics have been developed so much since Spohr\\'s time that his\\ncompositions do not present alarming difficulties to contemporaneous\\nperformers. Nevertheless, they were sufficiently difficult at the time of\\ntheir production, and they remain among the acceptable works for violin.\\nHis concertos--at any rate, the best of them--are heard occasionally\\nin concert rooms to-day, not without pleasure, though they are open to\\nthose objections which have been made against his operatic and orchestral\\nmusic. His earlier concertos show the immediate influence of Viotti and\\nRode, but his later works were the most valuable contribution that had\\nbeen made to the literature of the violin, except the Beethoven concerto\\nup to the time when Spohr ceased to compose them. Indeed Spohr must be\\ncredited with fully as earnest an endeavor to raise the violin concerto\\nfrom the level of a mere show piece to that of a serious and artistic\\ncomposition as either Beethoven or Mendelssohn. Paul David has rightly\\nsaid: \"It was mainly owing to the sterling musical worth of Spohr\\'s violin\\ncompositions that the great qualities of the classical Italian and the\\nParis schools have been preserved to the present day, and have prevented\\nthe degeneration of violin-playing.... He set a great example of purity\\nof style and legitimate treatment of the instrument--an example which has\\nlost none of its force in the lapse of more than half a century.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Signature]\\n\\n[Illustration: FRESCO IN VIENNA OPERA HOUSE.\\n\\nIllustrating Spohr\\'s Opera \"Jessonda.\"]\\n\\n[Illustration: CARL MARIA VON WEBER\\n\\n_Reproduction of a portrait at the British Museum drawn by C. Vogel,\\nDresden, 1823, and engraved by C. A. Schwerdgeburth. Weber in his\\nthirty-seventh year._]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCARL MARIA VON WEBER\\n\\n\\nThe plenitude of genius in the classical period of German music has a\\nstriking illustration in the rapid succession in the kingship which\\nfollowed the wresting of the musical sceptre from Italy. Beginning with\\nBach, there has been no break in the line of succession. Had such a\\nthought occurred to the father of modern music, he might have established\\na sentimental foundation, a handgrasp, a kiss, or an apostolic laying on\\nof hands, which might have been transmitted down to our day without once\\nleaving the direct and royal line. In the musical succession there is\\nan over-lapping, a concurrence of reigns, nearly all the time. The most\\nsignificant phrase of this phenomenon is exemplified in the subject of\\nthis study. Gluck and Mozart might have come like the good fairies of the\\nnursery tale to kiss him in his cradle. Haydn and Beethoven might have\\nwaited till their salutations would inspire his youth. He himself might\\nhave blessed the infancy of Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Wagner.\\nThis it is which helped to give Carl Maria von Weber a position in musical\\nhistory which now we recognize to be commanding in a sense never realized\\nso fully before. His activities range over the territory through which\\nis drawn the indeterminate line of demarcation between the Classic and\\nRomantic schools. He embodies the spirit of both tendencies, though not\\nin an equal degree. Not only does he touch hands with the kings of the\\neighteenth century and their successors of the nineteenth, but some of\\nhis life threads in the fabric of history were interwoven with theirs. We\\nshall see how in the story of his life.\\n\\nThe influence of heredity has a twofold illustration in this story. The\\nmusical talent of Weber and, indeed, the general bent of his artistic\\npredilections were an inheritance. An ardent devotion to music and the\\ndrama can be traced back a century in the family from which he sprung.\\nThe family belonged to the minor nobility of Austria. Of the tastes\\nand inclinations of the first Freiherr von Weber, who was endowed with\\nthe title in 1622, nothing is known. But a brother, who had taken up a\\nresidence in Suabia, probably after the loss of the family estates in the\\nThirty Years\\' War, was musical. He was the ancestor of Fridolin Weber,\\nwho, in turn, was the father of several daughters who would have merited\\na paragraph in the annals of music had they not won a page through the\\ncircumstance that Mozart fell in love with one, Aloysia, and married\\nanother, Constance. Franz Anton von Weber, a brother of this Fridolin,\\nwas the father of Carl Maria, who through Constance became cousin by\\nmarriage to Mozart. The brothers, though many other things besides, during\\nthe latter portion of their existence were, for the purpose of gaining a\\nlivelihood, musicians. Fridolin, who had dropped the \"von\" from his name\\nwhen Mozart met him in Mannheim, was reduced to the position of a sort\\nof general utility man in the Court Theatre; Franz Anton, who clung to\\nthe sign of nobility and conveyed other titles to himself to which he had\\nless right, enjoyed the distinction of being one of the best viola players\\nof his time and was also an admirable performer upon the double-bass. He\\neven ventured upon the sea of composition with some songs with pianoforte\\naccompaniment, which frail craft bore him up for a considerable time.\\n\\nHere was one manifestation of the law of heredity; contemplation of the\\nother is less agreeable. From Franz Anton von Weber his son inherited an\\ninstability of character which for a time threatened to make shipwreck\\nof his divine gifts. The whole of Franz Anton\\'s life was the career of\\nan adventurer. In his youth he was a titled rake in Mannheim. He became\\na soldier and was slightly wounded fighting against Frederick the Great\\nat Rosbach. The Elector of Cologne, Clement Augustus, gave him an\\nappointment and on the death of his father-in-law advanced him to the\\nposts which the latter had held--Steward and Court Councillor. From\\nthese posts he was dismissed with a small pension by Clement Augustus\\'s\\nsuccessor in the Electorate. It is said that his devotion to music was\\npartly the cause of his dismissal. He was fonder of his fiddle than of\\nhis duties, and often went walking in the fields, playing on his viol,\\nhis eight children trooping behind him as if he were another Pied Piper.\\nHe married into a councillorship and fiddled himself out of it. The\\nPrince-Bishop who appointed him was the gay prelate who \"danced himself\\nout of this world into another\" and who gave employment to Beethoven\\'s\\ngrandfather and father in his court band; the Prince-Bishop who dismissed\\nhim was the serious-minded and thrifty Maximilian Frederick, who became\\nthe master of Beethoven himself. Those who are fond of delving for remote\\ncauses may associate the birth of Weber with this action of Beethoven\\'s\\npatron. Franz Anton, having lost his position and squandered his wife\\'s\\nfortune, started out on a dramatic and musical itinerancy. His wife did\\nnot survive her humiliation. He wandered through Germany after three years\\nof service as Chapelmaster to the Bishop of Lubeck and Eutin, and in\\n1784 found his way to Vienna, where he placed two of his sons under the\\ntuition of Haydn, and a year later married the sixteen-year-old Genoveva\\nvon Brenner, a daughter in the family that had given a home to his sons.\\nThis delicate flower the adventurer of fifty plucked out of its genial\\nsurroundings in the Austrian capital and transplanted to Eutin, whither he\\nnow returned to accept the post of town musician, another having meanwhile\\nwon the once despised but now coveted chapelmastership. Small wonder\\nthat when Carl Maria Friedrich Ernest, the first child of this mistaken\\nmarriage was born he should have brought with him into the world a frail\\nand puny body afflicted with a disease of the hip which was the cause of\\nthe composer\\'s lifelong lameness.\\n\\nConcerning the date of Carl Maria\\'s birth there is still controversy. The\\nchurch records in Eutin give it as November 18, 1786. The date commonly\\naccepted is December 18, 1786. When the boy\\'s first composition was\\npublished the father did not hesitate to falsify his age by a year in\\norder to irritate the attention of the _cognoscenti_. The impulse which\\nprompted what must have seemed a trifling peccadillo to the unscrupulous\\nFranz Anton sprang from an ambition which had long consumed his heart and\\nhad been intensified by the marvelous career of his nephew by marriage,\\nMozart: He wished to figure in the world as father of a prodigy. He had\\nbeen disappointed in the children of his first marriage who, with finer\\nfacilities than Carl Maria ever enjoyed, had turned out to be simply good\\nworking musicians. The forcing process which he applied in the case of his\\nyoungest son was in no respect beneficial. The boy, too, was ambitious to\\nbe a Mozart, but in later life, speaking of his second opera, composed at\\nthe age of thirteen, he mentioned the circumstance that he had written the\\nsecond act in ten days, and added: \"This was one of the many unfortunate\\nconsequences of the numerous tales of the great masters which made so\\ngreat an impression on my juvenile mind, and which I tried to imitate.\"\\nThe demand which the father made upon the precocious mind of his son was\\nin reality greater than that made upon the boy Mozart\\'s. Leopold Mozart\\nwas an ideal instructor and a man of fine moral fibre. In his exploitation\\nof Wolfgang he never sacrificed the things which make for good in art. He\\nmay have been injudicious in fanning the spark of genius so industriously\\nthat it burst into the too-fierce flame which consumed his son\\'s life\\nprematurely, but the technical training which Wolfgang enjoyed was sound\\nand thorough. This boon was never accorded to the boy Weber. While his\\nfather continued the roving life which began anew a year after Carl\\nMaria\\'s birth, he and his son Frederick cared for the lad\\'s education.\\nThere was no more stability in the life of the family than in that of a\\ngypsy band. Within a dozen years the father figured in one theatrical\\ncapacity or another in Vienna, Cassel, Meiningen, Nuremberg, Augsburg,\\nWeimar, Erlangen, Hilburghausen and Salzburg. Only in the last two\\ntowns does it appear that he procured proper instruction for the child.\\nEvidently with all his desire to play the role of a second Leopold Mozart\\nhe mistrusted his son\\'s gifts, for he once contemplated making a painter\\nout of him, and even after he had exhibited noteworthy fruits of the few\\nmonths of study pursued under Michael Haydn in Salzburg, and Kalcher in\\nMunich, he seemed willing to sacrifice his son\\'s musical talents to the\\nprospect of making money with Senefelder\\'s new invention of lithography,\\nin which both father and son took a keen interest. The influence of such\\nan irresolute life upon the lad\\'s moral character must also have been\\npernicious. He grew up behind the scenes of a theatre. One can easily\\nimagine the value of the familiarity with the mimic world thus obtained\\nafter he had become a dramatic composer, but it fastened a clog upon his\\ntalent which he was never quite able to fling off. When a good teacher,\\nwho valued his gifts and devoted himself assiduously to their development,\\nwas found in Hilburghausen, study had already become irksome to the lad.\\n\\nMichael Haydn had been his master for only six months when, his mother\\nhaving died of consumption in March, 1798, he accompanied his father to\\nVienna and remained there till July. Next came a removal to Munich, and\\nstudy under Kalcher for composition and Wallishauser (of Valesi, as he\\ncalled himself) for singing. Even with imperfect cherishing, however, the\\nboy\\'s creative faculty asserted itself. The first of his music which was\\npublished consisted of six fughettos written under the eyes of Michael\\nHaydn. Guided by Kalcher he composed an opera, \"Die Macht der Liebe und\\ndes Weins,\" a mass and several vocal and instrumental pieces in the\\nsmaller forms. All of this music is lost except a set of variations which\\nhe dedicated to his teacher and printed himself by the new lithographic\\nmethod.\\n\\n[Illustration: WEBER\\'S BIRTHPLACE IN EUTIN, NORTH GERMANY.]\\n\\nWe have written with somewhat disproportionate fullness of the beginning\\nof Weber\\'s career because of the light which the recital throws upon\\nhis moral as well as his musical development. Fate had it in store that\\na lovely character and a genius of high order should emerge from the\\nunsightly and much-abused chrysalis; but before then another decade had\\nto be spent under such circumstances as ordinarily wreck men\\'s souls. In\\nthis period the interruptions of the peripatetics which had been the curse\\nof his childhood, were few and comparatively brief. Freiberg, in Saxony,\\nChemnitz, Salzburg, and Augsburg, were in turn the lad\\'s stopping-places,\\nand a tour was made through Northern Germany. Then came two years of\\nstudy in Vienna with Abbe Vogler, rewarded by an appointment which the\\nAbbe procured for the youth of seventeen and a half as Capellmeister in\\nBreslau. For two years he performed the duties of this office, and then\\ndisaffections and quarrels between him and the citizens who maintained the\\ncompany led to his resignation. The influence of a pupil got him the title\\nof Musik-Intendant to Duke Eugene of Wirtemberg, which he intended to use\\nfor advertising purposes on a concert tour; but war interfered with the\\nplan and he went to Schloss Carlsruhe to participate in the music-making\\nat the Duke\\'s court. The conquest of Prussia by Napoleon in 1807 led the\\nDuke to dismiss his band, but he obtained for Weber the post of Private\\nSecretary to a brother, Duke Ludwig, at Stuttgart. The associations\\ninto which this new life threw him were more demoralizing a thousand\\ntimes than any of his past experiences. The profligacy and immorality of\\nthe official and theatrical life of the Suabian capital were notorious\\nthroughout Europe. The charm of Weber\\'s mind and manners drew about him\\nmany good influences, particularly the friendship of Capellmeister Danzi,\\nbut the moral stamina to withstand the temptations which beset him on\\nall hands had not been developed, and he abandoned himself to a course\\nof life which threatened his moral as well as artistic ruin. His boon\\ncompanions were one of the sirens of the theatre and the members of a\\ncoterie known as \"Faust\\'s Descent into Hell.\" From the dangers which beset\\nhim he was most rudely rescued. He had incurred the anger of the King\\nwhile delivering one of the many unpleasant messages of Duke Ludwig, who\\nwas the King\\'s brother, and avenged himself for the contumely poured on\\nhim by directing an old woman, who had inquired for the Royal laundress,\\ninto the King\\'s cabinet. It required the intervention of the Duke to save\\nhim from imprisonment, but the King\\'s anger was not appeased, and he soon\\nfound occasion to punish Weber for the insult. The misrepresentations\\nof a servant to a citizen from whom Weber borrowed money led the former\\nto believe that the loan would purchase an appointment for his son in\\nthe Duke\\'s household and consequent immunity from military service. The\\nappointment not following, Weber was denounced to the King, tried by a\\nprocess quite as summary as a drum-head court-martial, and banished from\\nWirtemberg along with his father, in whose behalf the loan had been made.\\nIt was the year 1810, and it marks Weber\\'s moral regeneration. He resolved\\nthereafter to devote himself honestly and seriously to the service of\\nhis art. His artistic achievements during this decade were scarcely\\nsignificant enough to outweigh the unhappy incidents of his life. At\\nFreiberg he forgot his father\\'s lithographic schemes long enough to set an\\nopera book written by Ritter von Steinsberg on the familiar folk-tale of\\nthe Seven Ravens, entitled \"Das Stumme Waldmadchen,\" which was performed\\nin Freiberg, Chemnitz, Prague and even Vienna and St. Petersburg, without\\nmaking a decided success. In the course of his second stay in Salzburg he\\ncomposed \"Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn,\" which was brought out with\\nindifferent results at Augsburg. During his trip through Northern Germany\\nhe developed a thirst for theoretical knowledge and also a bent toward\\nliterature which grew with time, made him a student of the writings of\\nKant and Schelling, in Stuttgart, and filled his head for a space with\\nthoughts of a critical journal. His choice of Abbe Vogler as a teacher\\nhas generally been deplored, but it seems to have been beneficial in this\\nrespect, at least, that under the influence of that man of brilliant if\\nsuperficial talents, he ceased the production of unripe works and took up\\nthe analysis of masterpieces and the study of folk-music. The circumstance\\nthat his writings for two years are practically summed up in a pianoforte\\narrangement of the Abbe\\'s opera \"Samori\" and two sets of variations\\non themes from that opera and \"Castor and Pollux\" might be variously\\ninterpreted. The Abbe had the gift of attaching young men to himself and\\nwas probably not averse to such tributes as his affectionate pupils paid\\nhim in the revamping of his ideas; but if Weber\\'s own testimony is to\\nbe accepted he must have helped him greatly in the direction where his\\ngreatest needs lay. In Breslau he began the composition of \"Rubezahl\"\\n(text by J. G. Rhode, the managing director of the private company that\\nmaintained the theatre), and composed an a Overturn Chinesa,\" utilizing\\nfor the purpose a Chinese melody entitled \"Lieu-ye-kin.\" This overture\\nhe remodeled a few years later and prefixed it to Schiller\\'s adaptation\\nof the Italian Gozzi\\'s masque \"Turandot\" for which he also composed six\\nincidental pieces. How one who was so happy a few years later in the\\napplication of local color should have persuaded himself to use a Chinese\\nmelody with its characteristic pentatonic scale in an overture to a play\\nbased on a Persian subject does not appear. Weber\\'s stay with Duke Eugene\\nwas not without profit, though his compositions were chiefly instrumental\\nand, barring two symphonies, in the smaller forms. In Stuttgart where\\nhis musical services to Duke Ludwig were confined to instructing his\\nchildren, he undertook a resetting of \"Das Stumme Waldmadchen,\" the book\\nof which had been worked over by Franz Carl Hiemer, the leading spirit\\nof the dissolute coterie known as \"Faust\\'s Hollenfahrt.\" Weber seems\\nto have spent two years on this work, or rather to have spread it out\\nover two years of time, a circumstance which, when contrasted with the\\nrapidity of his work on his second opera as a lad of thirteen, tells its\\nown tale of the effect of the influences which surrounded him. It was\\nat a rehearsal of this opera, renamed \"Sylvana,\" that the King chose to\\nhave him arrested to gratify a petty vengefulness. The work came into new\\nnotice in connection with the German celebrations of Weber\\'s centenary\\nin 1886 by reason of a second revision and revival after it had been\\nforgotten for full half a century. This \"revision,\" however, for which\\nErnst Pasque and Ferdinand Langer are responsible, is almost if not quite\\nas original a piece of work as that done by Weber in the remodeling of\\n\"Das Stumme Waldmadchen.\" The three-act play is expanded into one of four\\nacts; the dumb maiden is metamorphosed into a particularly brilliant\\n_soprano leggiero_; a ballet is introduced consisting of the \"Invitation\\nto the Dance,\" which was composed in 1817, and the Polonaise in E-flat\\nwhich dates back to the Stuttgart period; several of Weber\\'s songs are\\ninterpolated (a hint of Widor\\'s having seemingly been acted on), and vocal\\nnumbers are constructed out of two sonata movements.\\n\\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF WEBER, IN HIS TWENTY-FOURTH YEAR.\\n\\nPainted by Jos. Lang, the actor-painter (brother-in-law of Mozart).\\nEngraved by Joh. Neidl.]\\n\\nWith the expulsion from Stuttgart Weber\\'s wanderings began again, and\\nfor several years, the rest of the time indeed which may be counted\\nin the period preparatory to his entrance upon his estate as a genius\\nconscious of a mission and equipped for its performance, his life is like\\nthat of a minstrel knight of old, save for the difference in social and\\nartistic environment. At the very outset of these final peregrinations\\nthere is noticeable a sign of his moral regeneration, preceding only by\\na little most convincing evidences of a determination to make good also\\nthe artistic shortcomings due to his desultory early training and his\\nlater frivolities. Toward the close of 1810 he wrote in his journal: \"I\\ncan say calmly and truthfully that I have grown to be a better man within\\nthe last ten months. My sad experiences have made me wiser, I am become\\norderly in my business affairs and steadily industrious.\" The men whose\\nfriendship he cultivated on his travels were worthy of the best he could\\noffer, and he made no more companionships that were hindrances to his\\ngrowth. In Mannheim, whither he first went with letters from Danzi, it was\\nthe theoretician Gottfried Weber who gave him encouragement, help and a\\nfriendship that lasted till death. In Darmstadt began a lovely intercourse\\nwith Meyerbeer, who was then studying with Vogler, and whose parents\\nreceived him like one of the family when he went to Berlin. In Hamburg\\nhe met E. T. A. Hoffman, that incarnation of the Romantic spirit; and in\\nMunich he formed a social and artistic connection with the clarinettist,\\nBarmann, which was a source of delight and profit to them both. Duke Emil\\nLeopold August, of Saxe Gotha, with all his crazy eccentricities, was a\\nkind patron, at whose court he came into close relationship with Spohr,\\nwhom he had first met at Stuttgart, and on whom he had made an unfavorable\\nimpression. He went to Weimar, and learned to love Wieland and would\\nalso doubtless have bent the knee to Goethe, had that great man treated\\nhim with a little more than scant courtesy. It would seem, however, as\\nif the great poet had imbibed, consciously or unconsciously, some of the\\nprejudice against Weber which his musical oracle, Zelter, cherished.\\nWeber\\'s resolve to give truer devotion to his art bore fruit first in a\\nheightened appreciation of the value of criticism. Not only did he seek\\nto profit by the censure bestowed on his own works on the score of a want\\nof plastic beauty and soundness of form, but he sought to give greater\\ndignity to criticism by cultivating it himself. In Darmstadt he joined\\nMeyerbeer and others in organizing a secret society which had for a motto\\n\"the elevation of musical criticism by musicians.\" He even recurred to his\\nold project of founding a critical journal, and though he did not carry it\\nout, he was thus in a sense a forerunner of Schumann, as the \"Harmonischer\\nVerein\" (thus the critical coterie called itself) was a prototype of the\\n\"Davidsbundler.\" His conviction that he was profiting by his more serious\\nstudies and loftier determination is seen, moreover, in his desire to\\nbetter his earlier work. He did not try to complete the opera \"Rubezahl,\"\\nbut he remodelled its overture, which he thought his finest achievement\\nup to that time, and also the overture to \"Peter Schmoll.\" In his one-act\\noperetta \"Abu Hassan,\" composed during a second stay in Mannheim after\\nhis return from Frankfort, where he had produced \"Sylvana\" successfully,\\nmodern critics have found the buds of that dramatic genius which came into\\nfull flower in \"Der Freischutz.\" His fondness for literary composition\\ngrew so strong in this period that, not content with critical essays,\\nhe ventured upon a work of fiction. It is impossible not to see in this\\ncircumstance and also in the title chosen for the romance, \"Tonkunstler\\'s\\nErdenwallen,\" a suggestion which Wagner acted on when a generation later\\nhe wrote: \"Ein Ende in Paris,\" and \"A Pilgrimage to Beethoven.\"\\n\\nWe have reached a point in Weber\\'s career when his aims, ambitions,\\nmethods and achievements present so many parallels with those of his\\ndirect successor in art that the temptation is strong to put aside the\\nstory of the man in favor of an essay in comparative criticism. Each\\nsucceeding event in the next few years of his life helps to bring those\\nparallels into a light which is particularly vivid to us who view them\\nfrom the vantage ground of to-day. When he goes to Prague in January,\\n1813, to organize a German Opera, we see him enter the portal of the\\ntemple which enshrined the goddess of his later idolatry. When he emerges\\nfrom that temple it is as the High Priest of a new cult, consecrated for\\nthe greater task which he accomplished in Dresden, whither he went in\\n1817. The consecration was two-fold; it entered into his moral life and\\npurged it of the last husks of folly when he married Caroline Brandt on\\nNovember 4, 1817; it entered into his artistic life when he conceived his\\nmission to be to stimulate a national art-spirit in his country worthy\\nof the spirit of patriotism which had enabled the German people to rid\\nthemselves of a foreign oppressor. In Prague he formed his last ignoble\\nattachment. It was for the wife of a dancer at the opera, whose purposes\\nwere all mercenary, and whose husband was willing to trade in his wife\\'s\\nhonor. The _liaison_ caused immeasurable suffering to the gentle soul of\\nWeber, and was the last of his purging fires. The solace which he found in\\nthe love of the singer who had sung in his \"Sylvana\" at Frankfort and been\\nengaged at Prague at his instance, was perfect. Caroline Brandt did not\\naccept him lightly, and he had time, while wooing her, to learn the value\\nof her sweet purity and recover from the wounds struck by a degrading\\npassion.\\n\\nThe spirit of Romanticism which had long before been breathed into German\\nliterature and encouraged patriotism by disclosing the treasures of\\nGerman legendary lore, became a vital force when patriotic sentiments\\nwere transmuted into deeds of valor. Theodor Korner was the incarnation\\nof that political ecstacy which had been nourished by the Tugendbund. In\\nthe youth of Germany, especially in the students, his songs produced a\\nsort of divine intoxication. Part of Weber\\'s summer vacation in 1814 was\\npassed in Berlin. Prussia was leading in the struggle to throw off the\\nyoke of Napoleon, and Weber drank daily of the soma-juice in Korner\\'s\\n\"Lyre and Sword.\" On his return trip to Prague he visited his old friend\\nthe Duke Emil August at his castle Grafen-Tonna. From this old feudal\\npile he sent his settings of \"Lutzow\\'s wilde Jagd\" and \"Das Schwertlied\"\\nto his love in Prague. The world has never ceased to marvel at the fire\\nof those settings; who shall describe their effect in Germany at the time\\nthey were written? They were sparks hurled into the powder-magazine of\\nnational feeling. All things were conspiring to develop Weber\\'s Germanism\\nfrom an emotion into a religion. The \"Hurrah!\" of his apostrophe to the\\nsword found an echo at Waterloo. He planned a cantata to celebrate the\\nevent. It was not musical taste as much as patriotic ardor to which\\nthe circumstances compelled him to appeal. \"Kampf und Sieg\" is another\\n\"Wellington\\'s Victory,\" containing the same vulgar realism (the noises of\\nbattle, etc.), but disclosing also a higher artistic striving. Beethoven\\nused national melodies to characterize the warring soldiery: the \"Chanson\\nde Malbrouk\" for the French, and \"Rule Britannia\" for the English. Weber\\nutilized the revolutionary \"Ca ira\" for the French \"God save the King\"\\nfor the English, the Austrian and Prussian grenadier marches and the\\nrefrain from his own \"Lutzow.\" The latter circumstance may be looked upon\\nas evidence of the popularity which the spirited song had won within a\\nyear.\\n\\n[Illustration: WEBER\\n\\n_Drawn and executed in lithography by G.

In Berlin Brentano offered him the subject\\nof \"Tannhauser\" for treatment. He had considered the story of \"Der\\nFreischutz\" as far back as 1810. He was not ready for such work until he\\nhad fought the fight for a German operatic institution in Prague and in\\nDresden. In one respect the conditions were more favorable in the Bohemian\\ncapital than in the Saxon. In the former it was chiefly indifference and\\nignorance with which he had to contend; in the latter the patriotic fires\\nwhich might have been helpful were buried under the ashes of hatred of\\nPrussia. The splendid Teutonism of Weber was tolerated with ill grace,\\nand the intrigues of his associate Morlacchi, at the head of the Italian\\nopera, were permitted to make fourfold more difficult the stupendous task\\nof building up a German opera in a city that had always been dominated by\\nItalian influences in art. It was four years before Weber could take the\\nstep which to us looks like an appeal from the Saxon court to the German\\npeople. The case was that of \"Der Freischutz\" against the Italian regime,\\nand it was tried and won on June 18, 1821, in the new opera house in\\nBerlin.\\n\\nThe Italian regime was maintained in Dresden through the efforts of the\\nconductor of the Italian Opera, Morlacchi, the concert-master Polledro,\\nthe church composer Schubert, and Count von Einsiedel, Cabinet Minister.\\nThe efforts of these men placed innumerable obstacles in Weber\\'s path and\\ntheir influence heaped humiliations upon him. Confidence alone in the\\nultimate success of his efforts to regenerate the lyric drama sustained\\nhim in his trials. Against the merely sensuous charm of suave melody\\nand lovely singing he opposed truthfulness of feeling and conscientious\\nendeavor for the attainment of a perfect _ensemble_. Here his powers of\\norganization, trained by his experience in Prague, his perfect knowledge\\nof the stage imbibed with his mother\\'s milk, and his unquenchable zeal\\ngave him amazing puissance. Thoroughness was his watchword. He put\\naside the old custom of conducting while seated at the pianoforte and\\nappeared before his players with a _baton_. He was an inspiration, not a\\nfigure-head. His mind and his emotions dominated theirs and were published\\nin the performance. He raised the standard of the chorus, stimulated\\nthe actors, inspected the stage-furnishings and costumes and stamped\\nharmony of feeling, harmony of understanding, harmony of efforts upon the\\nfirst work undertaken--a performance of Mehul\\'s \"Joseph in Egypt.\" Nor\\ndid he confine his educational efforts to the people of the theatre. He\\ncontinued in Dresden the plan first put into practice by him in Prague\\nof printing articles about new operas in the newspapers to stimulate\\npublic appreciation of their characteristics and beauties. For a while the\\nwork of organization checked his creative energies, but when his duties\\ntouching new music for court or church functions gave him the opportunity\\nhe wrote with undiminished energy. His masses in E-flat and G were thus\\ncalled forth, and his \"Jubilee Cantata,\" the overture to which, composed\\nlater, is now a universal possession.\\n\\nThe year which gave him his wife also gave him the opera book with the\\ncomposition of which it was destined he should crown his career as a\\nNational composer. Apel\\'s \"Gespensterbuch\" had fallen into his hands\\nseven years before, and he had marked the story of \"Der Freischutz\" for\\ntreatment. His mind reverted to it again in the spring of 1817. Friederich\\nKind agreed to write the book and placed it complete in his hands on March\\n1st, nine days after he had undertaken the commission. Weber\\'s enthusiasm\\nwas great, but circumstances prevented him from devoting much time to the\\ncomposition of the opera. He wrote the first of its music in July, 1817,\\nbut did not complete it till May 13, 1820. It was in his mind during all\\nthis period, however, and would doubtless have been finished much earlier\\nhad he received an order to write an opera from the Saxon court. In this\\nexpectation he was disappointed, and the honor of having encouraged the\\nproduction of the most national opera ever written went to Berlin, where\\nthe patriotism which had been warmed by Weber\\'s settings of Korner\\'s\\nsongs was still ablaze and where Count Bruhl\\'s plans were discussing to\\nbring him to the Prussian capital as Capellmeister. The opera was given\\nunder circumstances that produced intense excitement in the minds of\\nWeber\\'s friends. It was felt that the patriotic interest which the name\\nand presence of Korner\\'s collaborator aroused would not alone suffice to\\nachieve a real triumph for a work of art. The sympathies of the musical\\nareopagus of Berlin were not with Weber or his work,--neither before nor\\nafter the first performance; but Weber spoke to the popular heart and its\\nquick responsive throb lifted him at once to the crest of the wave which\\nsoon deluged all Germany. The overture had to be repeated to still the\\napplause that followed its first performance, and when the curtain fell on\\nthe last scene a new chapter in German art had been opened.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE OLD MARKET SQUARE IN DRESDEN--From a photograph.\\n\\nThe house bearing sign on roof \"RENNER\" bears this inscription--\"Hier\\nschrieb 1819--C. M. von Weber--Der Freischutz.\"--(Here C. M. von Weber\\nwrote 1819 \"Der Freischutz.\")]\\n\\nThe difficulties which surrounded the production of \"Der Freischutz\" and\\nthe doubt felt touching its fate seemed to have almost unnerved Weber\\'s\\nfriends. He alone had remained undisturbed. For a year his mind had been\\nin a fever of creative activity. The incidental music for the melodrama\\n\"Preciosa\" had gone to Berlin with the score of \"Der Freischutz,\" and\\nbefore he left Dresden to produce his opera he had begun to work on the\\nmusic of \"Die drei Pintos,\" a comic opera for which Theodor Hill had\\nsupplied the book. On the eve of the great \"Freischutz\" day he composed\\nhis \"Concertstuck,\" which until recent years was the most universally\\npopular of his pianoforte compositions and now is esteemed as only second\\nto the exquisitely graceful, eloquent and romantic \"Invitation,\" which he\\ncomposed and dedicated to his wife shortly after his marriage.\\n\\nWeber had begun the hopeless fight against the disease that robbed him of\\nhis mother at the age of twenty-six years, before he came to Dresden. He\\ndid not possess the physical constitution for a long combat. He was small\\nand narrow-chested. Much of the superhuman energy which marked the last\\nfive years of his life was due to the unnatural eagerness of his mind to\\nput forth the whole of his artistic evangel before bodily dissolution\\nshould silence the proclamation.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it was sheer will-power that kept the vital fires\\nburning in his tortured body until the uttermost faggot of fuel which\\ncould nourish them was burned to ashes. The picture which Sir Julius\\nBenedict draws of him as he appeared when Sir Julius entered his house\\nto become his pupil in February, 1821, is indescribably pathetic in its\\nsimple eloquence: \"I found him sitting at his desk and occupied with the\\npianoforte arrangement of his \\'Freischutz.\\' The dire disease which but\\ntoo soon was to carry him off had made its mark on his noble features;\\nthe projecting cheek-bones, the general emaciation, told their sad tale;\\nbut in his clear eyes, too often concealed by spectacles, in his mighty\\nforehead fringed by a few straggling locks, in the sweet expression of\\nhis mouth, in the very tone of his weak but melodious voice, there was a\\nmagic power which attracted irresistibly all who approached him.\" The last\\nperiod of his life, the period in which he went on uninterruptedly from\\none great achievement to another, strengthening the foundations of the new\\nstructure his genius had reared, lifting it higher and extending it in all\\ndirections, was for his physical body but a period of torment. His rewards\\nwere many, but those which brought the greatest benison of felicity and\\ncomfort flowed from his domestic life, or came from without the province\\nof his official labors. Dresden shared the glory which he had won in\\nBerlin and elsewhere, but his masters refused him the honors the rest of\\nthe world was glad to give. His king denied him the petty insignias of\\ndistinction which no man in the kingdom had so richly earned, yet, though\\nopportunities offered (such as an invitation to become musical director\\nat Hesse Cassel) he refused to change his field of labor, inspired by a\\ndesperate determination to conquer the indifference of the Saxon court.\\n\"Der Freischutz\" had set Germany on fire, but its composer waited a year\\nbefore he was privileged to produce it in Dresden. Nearly three months\\nbefore that occurrence he received an invitation to compose an opera for\\nthe Karnthnerthor theatre, in Vienna, under the management of Barbaja.\\nHe chose the blue-stocking, Helmina von Chezy, as his collaborator, and\\nbegan work on \"Euryanthe.\" It was another tremendous stride in the path\\nof progress; but the world did not know it, for now Weber was the forward\\nman leading the way into the hitherto unexplored fields of dramatic\\nmusic. He went to Vienna in September, 1823, to bring out his new work.\\nOf all the incidents of the memorable visit none is more significant than\\nhis meeting with Beethoven. It was a tardy meeting. As lad and youth he\\nhad been in Vienna without manifesting the slightest desire to meet the\\ngreat master. In his self-elected capacity as critic he had attacked the\\nsymphonies in E-flat and B-flat. It is not improbable that it was the\\nstudy of \"Fidelio,\" which he produced at Prague, and afterward at Dresden,\\nthat opened his mind to the significant relationship which Beethoven\\nbore to his own efforts to reanimate a national art-spirit in Germany.\\nAt any rate when the composer of \"Euryanthe\" went to Vienna it was as a\\nmusician filled with veneration for the composer of \"Fidelio,\" and the\\nreception which he met with at the hands of the great man touched him\\nmost profoundly. \"We dined together in the happiest mood,\" Weber wrote to\\nhis wife; \"the stern, rough man paid me as much attention as if I were a\\nlady he was courting, and served me at table with the most delicate care.\\nHow proud I felt to receive all this attention and regard from the great\\nmaster-spirit; the day will remain forever impressed on my mind and those\\nof all who were present.\" Beethoven, it is said, promised to attend the\\nfirst performance of \"Euryanthe,\" which took place on October 25, but did\\nnot. He would have heard nothing of the music if he had, but there is a\\nstory that after the representation, which was tremendously successful, he\\nwrote to Weber: \"I am glad, I am glad! For this is the way the German must\\nget the upper hand of the Italian sing-song.\" The success of the opera was\\nnot lasting, however. It was marred by the dramatic faults of its book,\\nand after Weber\\'s departure its score was horribly disfigured by excisions\\nmade by Conradin Kreutzer.\\n\\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO WEBER IN DRESDEN.--From a photograph.\\n\\nErnst Rietschel, Sculptor.]\\n\\nThe vital forces were rapidly leaving Weber\\'s frail body. For nearly a\\nyear and a half after the completion of \"Euryanthe\" he composed nothing\\nexcept a French romance for voice and pianoforte. Then he marshalled his\\nintellectual and physical forces for a last endeavor. Charles Kemble\\nin 1824, stimulated by the success of \"Der Freischutz\" in London,\\ncommissioned him to compose an opera for Covent Garden. The work was to\\nbe in English, and after some correspondence on the subject Weber agreed\\nto compose an opera and produce it in person for an honorarium of ￡1,000.\\nWhile the negotiations were in progress he consulted his physician, who\\ntold him the acceptance of the commission would bring about his death in\\na few months, or even weeks, whereas a year\\'s respite from all work in\\nItaly would prolong his life five or six years. The sum offered was large\\nand Weber\\'s mind had been haunted by the apprehension of leaving his wife\\nand children unprovided for. He decided to sacrifice his life for the\\nwelfare of his family, and accepted the commission. The decision made, his\\nphysical and intellectual lassitude gave way to another fit of energy.\\nThe subject agreed on was \"Oberon,\" and Planche was to prepare the book.\\nAs a preparation, the dying composer learned English. The first two acts\\nof the book came into his hands on January 18, the third on February 1,\\n1825. He began at once but suspended it in order to take the waters at Ems\\nduring the summer. He resumed work in the fall and completed the overture,\\nwhich, in the usual manner of composers, he composed last, in London, on\\nApril 29, 1826. He had reached the city a week before, having travelled to\\nCalais in his own carriage and made a stop in Paris, where he was cheered\\nby the kind attention of men like Cherubini, Rossini, Onslow and others.\\nNo time was wasted in beginning the preparations for the production of\\n\"Oberon,\" nor, indeed, was there any time to waste. He superintended\\nsixteen rehearsals, and conducted the first performance on April 12, 1826.\\nIt was his last triumph; \"The composer had an even more enthusiastic\\nreception than Rossini two or three years before,\" says Spitta. Weber\\nconducted twelve performances according to contract, took part in a few\\nconcerts, gave one of his own which was a failure financially because\\nof the indifference of the aristocracy, and then in feverish anxiety to\\nsee his family again, began preparations for his return journey. On the\\nmorning of June 5, 1826, his host, Sir George Smart, found him dead in\\nhis bed: \"his head resting on his hand as if in sweet slumber; no traces\\nof his suffering could be seen in these noble features. His spirit had\\nfled--home indeed!\" His body was buried in Moorfields Chapel on June\\n21, but eighteen years later, largely through the instrumentality of\\nRichard Wagner, it was brought to Dresden and interred in the family\\nvault with impressive ceremonies. Wagner pronounced the oration at his\\nfinal resting-place, and thus emphasized the trait in his character which\\nlay at the foundation of his greatest achievement in art: \"Never lived a\\nmusician more German than thou! No matter where thy genius bore thee, in\\nwhat far-away unfathomable realm of fancy, always did it remain fastened\\nwith a thousand sensitive fibres to the heart of the German people,\\nwith which it smiled and wept like an undoubting child listening to the\\nfairy tales of its native land. This ingenuousness it was which led thy\\nmanhood\\'s mind like a guardian angel and preserved it chaste; and in this\\nchastity lay thy individuality: preserving this glorious virtue unsullied\\nthou wast lifted above the need of artificial invention. It was enough for\\nthee to feel, for when thou hadst felt then hadst thou already discovered\\nthe things which have been from the beginning. And this lofty virtue\\ndidst thou preserve even into thy death. Thou couldst not sacrifice it,\\nnor divest thyself of this lovely heritage of thy German lineage; thou\\ncouldst not betray us!--Behold, now the Briton does thee justice, the\\nFrenchman admires thee, but only the German can _love_ thee! Thou art his,\\na lovely day out of his life, a warm drop of his blood, a fragment of his\\nheart--who will blame us for wishing that thy ashes might become a portion\\nof his earth, his precious German earth?\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile letter from Weber replying to inquiry concerning\\nhis \"Jubel Overture\" and pianoforte Concerto. Also recommending Naumann\\'s\\n\"Pater Noster\" as a beautiful work.]\\n\\nThe works of Weber comprehend examples of nearly all the vocal and\\ninstrumental forms, except the sacred oratorio. He completed and\\npublished six operas, and left fragments of three others. Of his first\\nboyish effort, \"Die Macht der Liebe und des Weins,\" not a bar has\\nbeen discovered, and it is believed that he destroyed it. Of smaller\\ndramatic works including the melodrama \"Preciosa,\" the overture, and\\nincidental music for \"Turandot,\" airs for interpolation in operas of other\\ncomposers, etc., he wrote twenty-eight. His cantatas, using the word in\\nboth its old and newer sense as a composition for soli and chorus with\\naccompaniment, number eight. He wrote two masses and a separate offertory\\nfor each; ninety songs, ballads and romances for single voice with\\npianoforte or guitar accompaniment; nineteen part-songs for men\\'s voices;\\nfourteen canons, part-songs, etc., for mixed voices with and without\\naccompaniment; and he arranged ten Scotch songs. The summary of his purely\\ninstrumental music is not so large. He was not a master of the great epic\\nform, and the two symphonies which he composed have no significance in\\nan estimate of his work. In addition to the overtures to his published\\noperas he wrote three overtures which have appeared separately: that of\\n\"Peter Schmoll\" published as \"Grande Ouverture a plusieurs instruments,\"\\n\"Rubezahl,\" known as \"Beherrscher der Geister,\" and \"Jubel\"; he also\\nwrote five orchestral dances and marches. He composed three pianoforte\\nconcertos, ten smaller works with pianoforte accompaniment, thirteen\\nconcerted pieces for various solo instruments (clarinet, bassoon, flute\\nand violoncello) and orchestra, four pianoforte sonatas, seventeen\\npianoforte pieces of various other forms for two hands (counting sets of\\nFughetti, Allemandes, Ecossaises and Waltzes as single numbers) and twenty\\nsimilar pieces for four hands.\\n\\nWeber\\'s significance lies in his dramatic works. His songs, charmingly\\npoetical and beautiful as many of them are, have been pushed into the\\nbackground by those of his contemporary Schubert and his successors in the\\nsong-field, Schumann, Franz and Brahms. His part-songs for men\\'s voices,\\nespecially his settings of Korner\\'s patriotic lyrics, will probably be\\nsung as long as the German gives voice to his love of Fatherland through\\nthe agency of _Mannergesangvereine_. It is no depreciation of their\\nartistic merit, however, to say that they fill a much larger page in the\\nsocial and political history of Germany than in the story of musical\\nevolution. As a composer for the pianoforte Weber long ago became archaic.\\nHis sonatas are seldom heard now-a-days outside of historical recitals\\nwhose purpose is, in the first instance, instructive. The \"Concertstuck,\"\\nonce the hobby of nearly all performers of the brilliant school, is\\nrapidly sinking into neglect, and one might attend concerts for a decade\\nin Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna, Boston or New York without hearing\\neither of the other concertos. The circumstance that in the \"Concertstuck\"\\nand the \"Invitation to the Dance,\" Weber displayed a distinctly Romantic\\ntendency in the sense of striving to give expression to a poetical conceit\\nplaced at the foundation of the composition and kept in mind throughout,\\naccounts in a great degree for the greater vitality of these two works.\\nYet even the \"Invitation\" is admired more to-day in the embellished\\nversion of Tausig and the orchestral paraphrase of Berlioz than in its\\noriginal shape. The value of this exquisite little dramatic poem in\\ntones, we are inclined to place so high that the estimate may seem out\\nof all proportion with the rest of this review. The world has learned,\\nhowever, that merit lies in contents and felicity of expression rather\\nthan pretension and dimension, and in view of the subsequent idealization\\nof the dance by Chopin and his followers, we incline to the belief\\nthat what once may have been regarded as a trifle really outweighs in\\nimportance the bulk of Weber\\'s pianoforte pieces whose formal titles give\\nthem dignity. The professor and the amateur are one in their admiration\\nfor this delicious composition, and there is no one so unlearned in music\\nthat he may not arrive at the composer\\'s purpose from a simple hearing, so\\nhe bring love and a bit of fancy into the concert-room. How many pretty\\npictures of brilliant ball-rooms and loving couples has not this music\\nconjured up in the minds of imaginative people. Even old Dr. Brown, whose\\n\"Rab and his Friends\" will ever keep him dear to Anglo-Saxon hearts, felt\\nthe intoxication of these strains a quarter century ago, and put on record\\nin _The Scotsman_ one of the most eloquent critical rhapsodies extant.\\nHe pictures the ball-room, the lovers, the meeting in a shadowy recess,\\nwhere she (the interested maiden) had been left by her mother. He (a\\nLochinvar, of course) is bending down and asking her to tread a measure.\\nShe,--but we must let Brown go on in his own way--\"She looks still more\\ndown, flushes doubtless, and quietly in the shadow says \\'No\\' and means\\n\\'yes\\'--says \\'Yes\\' and fully means it, and they are off! All this small,\\nwhispered love-making and dainty device, this coaxing and being coaxed,\\nis in the (all too short for us, but not for them) prelude to the waltz,\\nthe real business of the piece and evening. And then such a waltz for\\nwaltzing! Such precision and decision! Whisking them round, moulding them\\ninto twin orbs, hurrying them past and away from everything and everybody\\nbut themselves.\" And so old Brown goes on until you are almost dizzy with\\nreading and entirely ready to vote that his rhapsody is only a little less\\ndelicious than Weber\\'s music. The decadence of the liking for chamber\\nmusic with wind instruments and of solos for them has relegated Weber\\'s\\ncompositions for the clarinet and its brethren of the harmonious choir to\\nthe museum of musical history.\\n\\nIt is then to his operas that we must go to study Weber\\'s music as an\\nexpression of artistic feeling and conviction and as an influence. He was\\none of the forward men of his art, one whose principles and methods are\\nas vital now as they were when he was yet alive in the body. In a very\\nsignificant sense they are still new to a large portion of the musical\\nworld. They are just dawning in Italy. It is through Wagner\\'s restatement\\nof them that they are acquiring validity in new fields. Weber\\'s full\\nstature, indeed, can only be seen in the light which the example of Wagner\\nthrows upon him. This light goes out in several directions, but in each\\ninstance it discloses Weber as a precursor. The intense Teutonism of\\nWagner which led him to aim at a resurrection in a new and glorified body\\nof the \"dramma per musica\" of the Florentine reformers was an inheritance\\nfrom his father-in-art and predecessor as Capellmeister at the Dresden\\nopera. The Romanticism of Weber displayed in his choice of subjects had\\na literary tincture; it went no further than it was propelled by the\\nexample of Tieck, Schlegel and their companions, and it was colored by\\nthe mystical and sentimental Catholicism which was one of the singular\\nreactionary fruits of the Romantic movement in German literature. Wagner\\'s\\nRomanticism is that of a period in which the pendulum had swung back\\nagain; it is psychological, almost physiological. The old myths will\\nnot serve in their mediæval form; they must be reduced to their lowest\\nterms. Yet though we note this difference in manifestation, the root of\\nWagner\\'s Romanticism strikes through Weber\\'s. We have seen how Weber\\'s\\nsincerity of purpose led him to overturn the humdrum routine of operatic\\nrepresentation. His made his intelligence and his feeling to illuminate\\nall sides of the work in hand. He was an intermediary not only between\\nthe composer and the performers in all departments, but also between the\\nart-work and the public. He was wholly modern in his employment of all the\\nagencies that offered to induct the public into the beauties and meanings\\nof the operas which he conducted. He was the precursor of Schumann, Liszt,\\nWagner, and all the present tribe of literary musicians. To do things\\nperfunctorily seems to have been foreign to his nature. He labored as\\nconscientiously to win appreciation for Marschner\\'s \"Heinrich IV. und\\nd\\'Aubigne\" and Meyerbeer\\'s \"Abimelek\" as for Beethoven\\'s \"Fidelio.\" It\\nis to Weber that we must trace the essential things which are recognized\\nto-day as marking the difference between German and Italian opera outside\\nof language and style of composition.\\n\\nIt is a fact, the bearing of which ought to be borne in mind while\\nstudying the significance of Weber in the development of music, that he\\ndid not enjoy the favor of the leading men amongst his contemporaries.\\nThe popularity of \"Der Freischutz\" always remained an enigma to Spohr,\\nand Schubert could find nothing to admire in \"Euryanthe.\" His want of\\nskill in the handling of form, which in the early part of his career\\nwe are justified in attributing to insufficient study, was an offence\\nwhich these men and the majority who were like-minded with them could\\nnot forgive. In his orchestral treatment, too, and his obvious leaning\\ntoward dramatic and spectacular effectiveness, they could only perceive\\nwhat is now termed sensationalism. The old notions of the relationship\\nbetween music and poetry were still almost universally valid. Beauty had\\nnot come to be looked upon as a relative thing; it was believed that to\\nbe real it must appeal to all alike and that those of its elements which\\nrested upon individual or national predilections were false in art.\\nCharacteristic beauty was an unknown quantity. Weber\\'s definition of an\\nopera when it was put forth sounded in the ears of his contemporaries like\\na heresy the realization of which would mean the destruction of operatic\\nmusic. We are become familiar enough with it since Wagner achieved his\\nreform, and therefore can scarcely appreciate how revolutionary it must\\nhave sounded three-quarters of a century ago. The opera, said Weber, is\\n\"an art work complete in itself, in which all the parts and contributions\\nof the related and utilized arts meet and disappear in each other, and,\\nin a manner, form a new world by their own destruction.\" A society in\\nBreslau applied to Weber for permission to perform \"Euryanthe\" in concert\\nstyle. Weber denied the request with the memorable words: \"\\'Euryanthe\\'\\nis a purely dramatic attempt which rests for its effectiveness upon the\\ncooperation of all the sister arts, and will surely fail if robbed of\\ntheir help.\" To these two definitions let us add two others touching\\nsinging and form: \"It is the first and most sacred duty of song to be\\ntruthful with the utmost fidelity possible in declamation\"; \"All striving\\nfor the beautiful and the new good is praiseworthy; but the creation of\\na new form must be generated by the poem which is setting.\" Here we find\\nstated in the plainest and most succinct terms the foundation principles\\nof the modern lyric drama. It may be urged that Weber did not pursue his\\nconvictions to their extremity as Wagner did, but returned in \"Oberon\"\\nto the simpler operatic style; but this, we are convinced, was partly\\nbecause of the intellectual and physical lassitude due to the consumption\\nof his vital forces, and partly because of his wish to adapt himself to\\nthe customs of the English stage and the taste of the people for whom he\\ncomposed his fairy opera. This is obvious not only from his letters to\\nPlanche, the librettist of \"Oberon,\" but from his subsequent effort to\\nremodel the opera to suit his own ideas \"so that \\'Oberon\\' may deserve the\\nname of opera.\" On February 16, 1825, he wrote: \"These two acts are also\\nfilled with the greatest beauties. I embrace the whole in love, and will\\nendeavor not to remain behind you. To this acknowledgment of your work\\nyou can give credit, the more as I must repeat, that the cut of the whole\\nis very foreign to all my ideas and maxims. The intermixing of so many\\nprincipal actors who do not sing, the omission of the music in the most\\nimportant moments--all these things deprive our \\'Oberon\\' of the title of\\nan opera, and will make him unfit for all other theatres in Europe, which\\nis a very bad thing for me, but _passons la dessus_.\" His adherence to the\\nbelief in the necessity of an intimate and affectionate relation between\\npoetry and music, moreover, has beautiful assertion in the concluding\\nwords of the same letter: \"Poets and composers live together in a sort of\\nangels\\' marriage which demands a reciprocal trust.\"\\n\\nIt is the manner in which he has wedded the drama with music which\\nmakes \"Euryanthe\" a work that, at times, seems almost ineffable. There\\nis no groping in the dark such as might have been expected in the case\\nof a pathfinder. Weber is pointing the way to thitherto undreamed-of\\npossibilities and means, yet his hand is steady, his judgment all but\\nunerring. The eloquence and power of the orchestra as an expositor of the\\ninnermost sentiments of the drama are known to him. Witness his use of\\nthe band in the _largo_ episode of the overture, designed to accompany\\na picture which Weber wished to have disclosed during the music for\\nthe purpose of giving coherency and intelligibility to the hopelessly\\ndefective book of the opera. Witness the puissance of the orchestra\\nagain in _Lysiart\\'s_ great air, \"Wo berg ich mich?\" _Euryanthe\\'s_\\nrecital of the secret, _Eglantine\\'s_ distraught confession, and more\\nstrikingly than anywhere else in the wondrously pathetic scene following\\n_Adolar\\'s_ desertion, and the instrumental introduction in the third\\nact in which is to be found the germ of one of Wagner\\'s most telling\\ndevices in \"Tristan\" and \"Siegfried.\" Witness also how brilliantly its\\ncolors second the joyous, sweeping strains which publish the glories of\\nmediæval chivalry. Will it ever be possible to put loftier sentiment and\\nsincerer expression into a delineation of brave knighthood and its homage\\nto fair woman than inspire every measure of the first act? Whither could\\nwe turn for more powerful expression of individual character through the\\nmeans of musical declamation than we find in the music of _Euryanthe_\\nand _Eglantine_? To Wagner\\'s honor it must be said that he never denied\\nhis indebtedness to Weber, but if he had it would have availed him\\nnothing while the representatives of the evil principle in \"Euryanthe\"\\nand \"Lohengrin\" present so obvious a parallel, not to mention Wagner\\'s\\ndrafts upon what may be called the external apparatus of Weber\\'s score.\\nSomewhat labored at times, and weighted with the fruits of reflection, the\\nmusic unquestionably is, but for each evidence of intellectual straining\\ndiscernible how many instances of highly emotionalized music, real,\\ntrue, expressive music, present themselves to charm the hearer, and with\\nwhat a delightful shock of surprise is not the discovery made that the\\nold-fashioned roulades, when they come (which they do with as much naivete\\nas in Mozart) have been infused with a dramatic potency equalled only by\\nMozart in some of his happiest inspirations? Of finest gold is the score\\nof \"Euryanthe.\" That it is come so tardily into its estate, and that\\neven to-day it is still underestimated and misunderstood, is the fault\\nof its libretto. Dr. Spitta has gallantly broken a lance in defence of\\nthe book, but no amount of ingenious argumentation can justify the absurd\\ncomplication created by the prudery of a German blue-stocking to avoid\\nShakespeare\\'s simple expedient, the \"mole, cinque-spotted.\" After all has\\nbeen said and done in defence of the book, the fact remains that it is the\\nattitude of the hero and heroine of the play to a mystery which is wholly\\noutside the action and cannot be brought within the sympathetic cognizance\\nof the spectators, that supplies the motive to the conduct of _Adolar_ and\\n_Euryanthe_.\\n\\n[Illustration: WEBER LEADING HIS OPERA OF \"DER FREISCHUTZ\" AT COVENT\\nGARDEN THEATRE IN 1826.\\n\\nFrom a characteristic and truthful lithographed sketch made shortly before\\nhis death and published by J. Dickinson, 114 New Bond Street, London.]\\n\\nThe device of introducing the _largo_ episode in the overture of\\n\"Euryanthe\" to accompany a tableau temporarily disclosed by the withdrawal\\nof the curtain, the tableau having a bearing on the ghostly part of the\\ndramatic tale, may be said to serve not only to prove Weber\\'s appreciation\\nof the fundamental defect of the book, but also to indicate his anxiety\\nto establish a more intimate relationship between the instrumental\\nintroduction and the drama. The choral \"Ave Maria\" in the overture to\\nMeyerbeer\\'s \"Dinorah\" and the Siciliano in the prelude to Mascagni\\'s\\n\"Cavalleria Rusticana\" are but variations of Weber\\'s futile invention.\\nIt would be unavailing to deny that the want of symphonic development\\nin Weber\\'s overtures, the circumstance that they are little else than\\npotpourris of melodies idealized in a manner by the splendor of their\\ninstrumentation, prevents them from aspiring to the dramatic dignity and\\nsignificance of such overtures as Mozart wrote for \"Don Giovanni\" and\\nBeethoven for \"Fidelio.\" As a creative composer Weber was first of all a\\nmelodist, secondarily a colorist. His want of constructive skill was held\\nup as a reproach to him by his colleagues all through his career. It is\\nnot to make a plea in behalf of lawlessness to say that this deficiency\\nin Weber\\'s artistic equipment was less detrimental to his works and\\ninfluence than a deficiency in any other department would have been. Not a\\ndestruction of form but an extension of forms, an adaptation of the vessel\\nto its new contents, was a necessary consequence of the introduction\\nof the Romantic spirit as a dominant element in music. The Romanticism\\nof the poets who inspired the musical Romanticists, consisted not only\\nin their effort to overthrow the stilted rhetoric and pedantry of the\\nGerman writers who were following stereotyped French models, but also in\\ntheir effort to disclose the essential beauty which pervades the world of\\nmystery beyond the plain realities of this life. They found the elements\\nof their creations in the imaginative literature of the Middle Ages,--the\\nmarvellous and fantastic stories of chivalry and superstition. A man like\\nSchumann touches hands with these poets in all of their strivings. His\\nmusic rebels against the formalism which had assumed despotic dominion\\nover the art, and also expresses the thousand and one emotions to which\\nthat formalism refused adequate expression. Weber\\'s art was so deeply\\nrooted in that of the last century that he could not place himself\\nwholly upon this level. His violations of conventional forms are less\\nthe fruit of necessity than the product of incapacity. His Romanticism,\\nexcept that phase which we have already discussed in connection with his\\npatriotic lyrics, had more of an external nature and genesis--it sprang\\nfrom the subjects of his operas. The treatment of these subjects by an\\ninstinctively truthful musical dramatist was bound to produce the features\\nin which that which is chiefly characteristic in Weber\\'s music is found.\\nThe supernaturalism of \"Der Freischutz\" and \"Oberon,\" the chivalresque\\nsentiment of \"Euryanthe\" and the national tinge of \"Preciosa,\" all made\\nnew demands upon music so soon as the latter came to be looked upon as\\nonly one vehicle of dramatic expression instead of the chief business of\\nthe piece. The musical investiture of necessity borrowed local elements\\nfrom the subject. Without losing its prerogative as an expounder of the\\ninnermost feelings of the drama it acquired a decorative capacity so\\nfar as the externals of the play were concerned. Music became frankly\\ndelineative. Whatever may be thought of descriptive music in connection\\nwith the absolute forms of the art there can be no question as to its\\njustification in the lyric drama where text, action and scenery are so\\nmany programmes, or guides to the purposes of the composer and the fancy\\nof the listener. The more material kind of delineation, that which helped\\nto heighten the effect of the stage pictures, to paint the terrors of the\\nWolf\\'s Glen with its infernal rout as well as the dewy freshness of the\\nforest and the dainty grace of the tripping elves, was paired with another\\nkind far more subtle. The people of the play, like their prototypes in the\\nmediæval romances, ceased to be representatives of universal types, and\\nbecame instead individuals who borrowed physiognomy from time, environment\\nand race. To give expression to the attributes thus acquired it became\\nnecessary to study the characteristics of those popular publications of\\nemotion which had remained outside the artificial forms of expression.\\nThe voice of the German people with their love for companionship, the\\nchase and nature, and their instinctive devotion to the things which have\\nsurvived as relics of a time when their racial traits were fixed in them,\\nWeber caught up from the Folk-song, which ever and anon in the history of\\nart, when music has threatened to degenerate into inelastic formalism,\\nhas breathed into it the breath of life. For the delineation of spiritual\\ncharacteristics Weber utilized the melodic and rhythmic elements of the\\npeople\\'s self-created popular songs; for material delineation his most\\npotent agency was instrumentation. To the band he gave a share in the\\nrepresentation such as only Beethoven, Mozart and Gluck before him had\\ndreamed of. The most striking feature of his treatment of the orchestra\\nis his emancipation of the wood-wind choir. His numerous discoveries in\\nthe domain of effects consequent on his profound study of instrumental\\n_timbre_ placed colors upon the palettes of every one of his successors.\\nThe supernatural voices of his Wolf\\'s Glen scene are echoed in Verdi\\nas well as in Meyerbeer and Marschner. The fairy footsteps of Oberon\\'s\\ndainty folk are heard not only in Mendelssohn but in all the compositions\\nsince his time in which the amiable creatures of supernaturalism are\\nsought to be delineated. The reform, not only in composition, but also\\nin representation achieved by Richard Wagner is an artistic legacy from\\nCarl Maria von Weber. It is but the interest upon the five talents given\\ninto the hands of a faithful servant who buried them not in the ground but\\ntraded with them \"and made them other five talents.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: [Music]\\n\\nFac-simile of full score of the beginning of Agatha\\'s great aria, from\\n\"Der Freischutz.\"]\\n\\n[Illustration: H.

For twenty-eight years he had been\\nRoyal Chapelmaster with salary and duties; for two years thereafter\\nGeneral Director of Music with a pension. Affecting a custom common\\namong the men of learning in Germany and the academic musicians of Great\\nBritain, he prefixed the title of his honorary university degree to his\\nsignature. He was Dr. H. Marschner. On court occasions he could bedizen\\nhis breast with baubles enough to make a brave show amongst the civil and\\nmilitary servants of his Hanoverian Majesty King George V. He was Knight\\nof the Order of the Saxon-Ernestine House; Knight of the Guelphic Order;\\nKnight of the Order of Danebrog; possessor of the Bavarian and Austrian\\nmedals for Merit in Art and Science. He was also Honorary Citizen of\\nHanover. He died suddenly of apoplexy at the age of sixty-six, before his\\ncapacity for work had become seriously impaired; his mind was occupied\\nwith a new opera when death overtook him. In his day and generation he was\\none of the most admired of Germany\\'s opera writers. He lived to see nearly\\nall of the colleagues and rivals of his prime die and their creations\\nfade out of public memory. Lindpaintner, Dorn, and Reissiger are names\\nthat come to our ears like faint echoes of once-living voices. Kreutzer\\nand Lortzing wake at long intervals in sporadic performances in small or\\nprovincial theatres. Marschner is in a more fortunate case, for his was\\ngreater genius. Three of his operas still have a considerable degree of\\nvitality, and some of his stirring part-songs for men\\'s voices are yet\\nsung and heard with delight. But only in Germany. Dust lies deep upon\\nhis pianoforte and chamber music wherever it is. Yet it is less than a\\ngeneration since he died. Day by day it becomes more difficult to assign\\nhim the place to which he is entitled in the Temple of Fame, for he wrote\\nfor but one people and his memory is perishing even amongst them.\\n\\nThe birth-place of Heinrich Marschner was Zittau in Saxony. He was born\\nAugust 16, 1795 and imbibed his love for music as most German boys of\\ngood family imbibe theirs. His father was fond of the art and it was\\nindustriously practised in the family. When the lad manifested an unusual\\ndegree of talent, the father, instead of becoming alarmed, encouraged its\\nuse, though he had no mind that his son should become a musician. Karl\\nGottlieb Hering, an eminent musical pedagogue at the time a teacher in\\nthe town Seminary, was called in to be the lad\\'s teacher. Meanwhile he\\npursued his other studies and in due time entered the Gymnasium where his\\nmusical gifts and lovely voice found occupation in the Gymnasial choir.\\nAt the solicitation of the music teacher in the Gymnasium at Bautzen he\\nwent thither for a space and sung the soprano solos in the Bautzen choir,\\nbut his voice changing he returned to his native town and there completed\\nhis lower studies. The political situation (it was in 1813 and Germany\\nwas preparing to rid herself of Napoleon) interfered with his father\\'s\\nwishes to have him proceed at once to Leipsic to take up the study of\\njurisprudence at the University. There was a brief respite which he spent\\nin Prague until the suspension of the truce compelled him to leave the\\nBohemian Capital. He returned to his home in Zittau for a short time, then\\nproceeded to Leipsic and was there a witness of the great three-days\\'\\nbattle. The brief stay in Prague had helped to keep the artistic fires\\nburning on the altar of his heart, for there he became acquainted with\\nJohann Wenzel Tomaschek, the Bohemian composer and teacher. Marschner was\\nmatriculated at the University so soon as the return of more peaceful\\ntimes permitted the step to be taken, and began his study of the law.\\nHis experience, however, was like that of Schumann later. While trying to\\nbe faithful to his Corpus Juris, he found the fascinations of Dame Music\\nstronger than his will. Some of his essays in composition were applauded\\nand he resolved to become a musician instead of a lawyer. Schicht, one\\nof Bach\\'s successors in the position of Cantor of the Thomas School was\\nnow his teacher, and in 1815 he felt himself sufficiently strong as a\\npianoforte virtuoso to undertake a concert tour to Carlsbad. There he\\nmet the Hungarian Count Thaddeus von Amadee, who persuaded him to seek\\nhis fortune in Vienna. He went thither in 1816, made the acquaintance\\nof Beethoven and, aided by the music-loving Count, was appointed to a\\nposition as teacher in Pressburg where three years later he married his\\nfirst wife, Eugenie Jaggi, and completed the first of his operas which\\nachieved the distinction of a representation. This opera was \"Henry IV.\\nand d\\'Aubigne\" which he sent to Weber at Dresden in 1818. A year earlier\\nhe had set Kotzebue\\'s \"The Kyffhaus Mountain.\" The title of this, his\\nfirst opera, indicates that his mind was from the beginning turned toward\\nthe legendary materials which afterward became the inspiration of the\\nNeo-Romantic school. It is possible, too, that this predisposition toward\\nthe supernatural was strengthened by an incident which has been related\\nby Louis Kohler in connection with the first representation of \"Henry\\nIV. and d\\'Aubigne.\" This story is to the effect that one night in 1819\\nMarschner, living far from Dresden (the year must have been 1820, the\\nplace Pressburg) dreamed that he was witnessing a performance of his\\nopera. The applause so excited him that he awoke and sprang from his\\nbed. Ten days later he received a letter from Weber enclosing ten ducats\\nhonorarium and conveying the intelligence that on the night of the dream\\n\"Henry IV. and d\\'Aubigne\" had been produced at Dresden with great success.\\nAs has already been indicated in one respect the credibility of the story\\nsuffers somewhat from analysis of its details. The fact that he dreamed\\nof a performance of his opera and the possibility of the influence of the\\ndream upon his mind need not be disputed. It is extremely improbable,\\nhowever, that he was ignorant of the date set for the performance as is\\nimplied in the story, for on July 7, 1820, twelve days before the first\\nrepresentation, Weber, in continuance of the friendly policy which he\\nadopted five years before in order to introduce Meyerbeer to Prague,\\npublished a description of the opera in the _Abendzeitung_ of Dresden.\\nIt seems to be beyond question, however, that Weber produced the opera\\nchiefly to encourage the young composer.\\n\\nAfter spending over five years in Pressburg, Marschner visited Saxony to\\nlook after some family affairs. The kindness with which Councillor von\\nKonneritz, Theatrical Intendant, and Weber received him, determined him\\nto remove to Dresden. His wife had died soon after marriage. He now took\\nup a residence in the Saxon Capital, and after he had composed incidental\\nmusic for Kleist\\'s drama, \"Prince Frederick of Homburg,\" he was by royal\\nrescript, dated September 4, 1824, appointed Royal Music Director of the\\nGerman and Italian Opera, becoming thus an associate of Weber, whose\\nfriendship manifested itself daily in the most helpful manner.\\n\\nMarschner\\'s \"Henry IV.\" was brought out by Weber in the year which gave\\n\"Der Freischutz\" to the world. It was followed by \"Saidar,\" words by Dr.\\nHornbostel, composed in 1819, \"The Wood Thief,\" words by Kind, the poet\\nof \"Der Freischutz,\" and \"Lucretia,\" words by Ehschlagen. \"Saidar\" was\\nperformed without success in Strassburg, \"The Wood Thief\" in January,\\n1825, in Dresden, and \"Lucretia\" in 1826 in Dantsic under Marschner\\'s\\ndirection. Weber\\'s death in London on June 5, 1826, marked a turning-point\\nin the energetic young composer\\'s career. Failing in the appointment to\\nthe post made vacant by Weber\\'s death, he severed his connection with the\\nDresden Theatre, married a singer named Marianne Wohlbruck on July 3, and\\na few months later removed to Leipsic.\\n\\nHis second marriage was celebrated at Magdeburg. A brother of the bride\\nwas Wilhelm A. Wohlbruck, to whom Marschner submitted the subject of \"The\\nVampire\" before he returned to Leipsic. Two years afterwards the opera had\\nits first representation. Its immediate success, and possibly his newly\\nattained domestic happiness, were a mighty spur to his industry and fancy.\\n\"The Templer and the Jewess,\" founded on Scott\\'s \"Ivanhoe,\" followed in\\n1829, and \"The Falconer\\'s Bride\" in 1830, Wohlbruck being the poet in both\\ncases. The triumph of \"The Vampire\" was eclipsed by that of \"The Templar\\nand the Jewess,\" whose chivalresque subject was naturally much more\\namiable than the gruesome story of \"The Vampire.\" Marschner\\'s attention\\nwas drawn to Scott\\'s \"Ivanhoe\" when, having been invited like Weber to\\ncompose an opera for London, he imitated Weber\\'s example and prepared\\nhimself for the work by learning English. \"The Vampire,\" translated by\\nPlanche, the librettist of \"Oberon,\" had been well received in London,\\nthough Planche took the liberty of changing the scene from Scotland, where\\nthe author of the story had placed it, to Hungary. Nothing came of the\\nLondon invitation, because of the burning of the Covent Garden Theatre.\\n\\nMarschner was now at the zenith of his fame. Toward the close of 1830\\nhe accepted an invitation to become Royal Chapelmaster at Hanover and\\ndistinguished himself at once in his new position by composing \"Hans\\nHeiling,\" his finest work and the strongest prop of his present fame. The\\nbook of this opera had been submitted to him anonymously. When the opera\\nwas first performed in 1833 in Berlin the librettist sang the titular\\nrole. It was none other than Edward Devrient. Marschner\\'s reception at\\nHanover was in every way distinguished, but long before his death he\\nforfeited some of the good will of the court circles and the portion of\\nsociety influenced by them. Domestic misfortunes doubtless contributed\\nmuch to embitter his disposition. He lost his wife in 1854. The immediate\\ncause of his withdrawal in 1859 from active service was the appointment\\nof C. L. Fischer as second Chapelmaster against his wishes. He lost\\nhis interest in the orchestra which he had brought to a high state of\\nefficiency and was pensioned off as a General Music Director. Before then\\nhe married a third wife, a contralto singer named Therese Janda of Vienna,\\nwho survived him. He died of an apoplectic stroke on December 15, 1861, at\\nnine o\\'clock in the evening. Besides the works mentioned in the foregoing\\nrecital, he composed \"The Castle on Aetna,\" \"The Babu,\" \"Adolph of\\nNassau,\" and \"Austin,\" operas, and incidental music to Kind\\'s \"Fair Ella,\"\\nHell\\'s \"Ali Baba,\" Rodenberg\\'s \"Waldmuller\\'s Margret\" and Mosenthal\\'s \"The\\nGoldsmith of Ulm.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of a letter thanking an unnamed composer for a\\nset of variations on themes from his opera \"Hans Heiling.\"]\\n\\nMarschner was not an old man when he died, yet his life compassed the\\nclimax of the Classic Period of German Music, the birth and development\\nof the Romantic School and the first vigorous stirrings of the spirit\\nexemplified in the latter-day dramas of Richard Wagner. He knew Beethoven,\\nstood elbow to elbow with Weber, fought by the side of Spohr and exerted\\nan influence of no mean potency in the development of Wagner. He was\\nthe last of the three foremost champions who carried the banner of\\nRomanticism into the operatic field. It is likely that had he asserted\\nhis individuality more boldly instead of fighting behind the shields of\\nhis two great associates the world would know better than it does that he\\nwas a doughty warrior; and criticism would speak less often of his music\\nas a reflection and of him as merely a strong man among the _epigonoi_\\nof Beethoven and Weber. Wagner set his face sternly against the estimate\\nwhich lowers him to the level of a mere imitator. Schumann esteemed his\\noperas more highly than those of any of his contemporaries, in spite of\\ntheir echoes of Weber\\'s ideas and methods. His record of the impression\\nmade on his mind by a performance of \"The Templar and the Jewess\" is a\\ncompact and comprehensive estimate of Marschner\\'s compositions: \"The music\\noccasionally restless; the instrumentation not entirely lucid; a wealth of\\nadmirable and expressive melody. Considerable dramatic talent; occasional\\nechoes of Weber. A gem not entirely freed from its rough covering. The\\nvoice-treatment not wholly practicable, and crushed by the orchestra. Too\\nmuch trombone.\"\\n\\nIt is scarcely to be marvelled at that the world should have accepted\\nthe old verdict. Outside of Germany Marschner has had no existence for\\nmore than half a century. In Germany three of his operas may occasionally\\nbe heard. All the rest of his list have disappeared from the stage as\\ncompletely as the hundreds of his compositions in the smaller forms.\\nThese three operas, \"The Vampire,\" \"The Templar and the Jewess\" and\\n\"Hans Heiling,\" not only contain his best music but also exemplify the\\nsum of his contributions to the Romantic movement. In them he appears in\\nhis fullest measure complementary to Weber and Spohr. Yet to appreciate\\nthis fact it is necessary to view them in the light of the time and the\\npeople for which they were created. It is scarcely possible to conceive\\ntheir existence, much less to perceive their significance under changed\\nconditions and beyond the borders of the German land. The measure of their\\npresent popularity in Germany is also the measure of their comparative\\nmerit. In them is exhibited Marschner\\'s growth in clearness, truthfulness\\nand forcefulness of expression and his appreciation of Romantic ideals.\\nAt this late day it is impossible to perceive anything else than a wicked\\nperversion of those ideals in \"The Vampire\"; yet it finds a two-fold\\nexplanation in the morbid tendency of literature and the stage in Europe\\ntwo generations ago, and the well-known proneness of the Germans to\\nsupernaturalism. The story is an excresence on the face of Romanticism\\nfor which the creators of the literary phase of the movement are not\\nresponsible. It tells of a nobleman who, having forfeited his life,\\nprolongs it and wins temporary immunity from punishment by drinking the\\nlife-blood of his brides, three of whom he is compelled by a compact with\\nthe Evil One to sacrifice between midnight and midnight once a year. At\\nthe base of this dreadful superstition lies the notion that the Vampire\\'s\\nunconquerable thirst for blood is a punishment visited upon a perjurer. It\\nmay be largely fanciful, but it must, nevertheless, not be overlooked in\\naccounting for the popularity of this subject that a degree of sympathy\\nfor it among the German people may have been due to the fact that it\\ncontains a faint mythological echo. In the Voluspa perjurers are condemned\\nin their everlasting prison-house to wade knee-deep in blood. It is this\\nsuperstition which prolongs the action in the opera until the fiend has\\nkilled two of his victims and stands before the altar with her who had\\nbeen selected as the third. In treating this gruesome subject Marschner\\nand his librettist compelled their hearers to sup full of horrors; nor\\ndid they scorn the melodramatic trick, which survived in the Bertrams\\nand Rigolettos of a later time, of investing a demon with a trait of\\ncharacter calculated to enlist sympathetic pity in his behalf. The direct\\nresponsibility for this bit of literary and theatrical pabulum rests with\\nByron. He wrote the tale for the delectation of his friends in Geneva.\\nBut the time was ripe for it. Planche adapted a French melodrama on the\\nsubject for London six years before he performed a similar service to\\nMarschner\\'s opera, and Lindpaintner composed his \"Vampire\" a year after\\nMarschner\\'s work had been brought forward.\\n\\n[Illustration: [Music]\\n\\nFac-simile autograph manuscript from \"Hans Heiling,\" written by Marschner.]\\n\\nThe frank supernaturalism of \"The Vampire,\" though it can only present\\nitself to us in the light of perverted and vulgarized Romanticism, made a\\npowerful appeal to the Germans with their innate if unconscious sympathy\\nwith the dethroned creatures of paganism. It was the vivid embodiment\\nof this sympathy which gave to the Romantic School the characteristic\\nelement which Marschner represents in his estate of originality. The\\nsupernaturalism which is little more than an influence in \"Der Freischutz\"\\nis boldly personified in \"The Vampire.\" Already at the outset of the\\nopera, the silent diabolism of Weber\\'s _Samiel_ is magnified and\\nmetamorphosed into a chorus of witches, ghosts, and devils. The opening\\nscene is a choral Wolf\\'s Glen, the copy going so far as the choice of\\nWeber\\'s key, F-sharp minor. Yet in spite of the imitation it is here\\nthat Marschner first struck the keynote of the strongest element of his\\ndramatic music,--the demoniac. It was the fault of the subject that he\\ncould not give a sign here of the element in which he is stronger still,\\nor at least, more original,--the element of rude humor. That manifestation\\nhad to wait for the coming of Friar Tuck in his setting of the story of\\n\"Ivanhoe.\" The third element in which the strong talent of the composer\\nmoves most freely and effectually is the delineation of folk-scenes.\\nHere he has followed closely in the footsteps of Weber and caught up the\\nspirit of the common people as they gave it expression in their songs and\\ndances. As Luther, in transforming a dialect into a literary language,\\ncaught the idiom from the lips of the people in the market-place, so Weber\\nand Marschner went for their folk-music to the popular revels in tavern,\\nfield, and forest.\\n\\nA want of dramatic cohesion and homogeneity has militated against \"The\\nTemplar and the Jewess,\" the only opera of the three which might by\\nvirtue of its subject, have achieved and retained popularity in England,\\nFrance and America as well as Germany. It suffers, too, in contrast with\\nWeber\\'s \"Euryanthe\" by reason of its failure to reach the lofty plane\\nof chivalresque sentiment on which Weber\\'s almost ineffable opera moves\\nwith an aristocratic grace and ease that put even \"Lohengrin\" to shame.\\nNevertheless, some of the significance of \"The Templar and the Jewess\"\\nmay be found in the evidences that \"Lohengrin\" is in part its offspring.\\nThe parallelisms are too striking to be overlooked, especially in the\\nordeals by which the two heroines are tried. The prayers of Rebecca and\\nElsa, the reliance of each upon a heaven-sent champion, the employment\\nof the accompanying wood-winds stamp them as sisters in art. In \"Hans\\nHeiling,\" the supernaturalism is greatly purified and idealized. The hero\\nof the opera is a king of underground spirits, who relinquishes his throne\\nfor love of a mortal maiden. He is deceived in his love, but stifles\\nhis desire for vengeance and returns to his old dominion. The musical\\nadvance over \"The Vampire\" is commensurate with the ethical. The musical\\ndeclamation approaches in truthfulness that of the modern lyric drama, and\\nan ingenious compromise is effected with the cumbersome device of spoken\\ndialogue. In the scenes which play on the earth, this relic of the old\\nGerman _Singspiel_ is retained; but in _Heiling\\'s_ subterranean kingdom\\nall speech is music.\\n\\n[Illustration: H. E. Krehbiel]\\n\\n[Illustration: FELIX MENDELSSOHN BARTHOLDY\\n\\n_Reproduction of an engraving after an oil portrait from life, made by\\nMendelssohn\\'s brother-in-law. W.

The family names are compound. Mendelssohn is German for son\\nof Mendel; Bartholdy is Hebrew for son of Tholdy. One key to his artistic\\ncharacter is the general culture, intellectual and social, of the man, for\\nwhich the opportunities were granted him from infancy in fuller measure\\nthan to any other great musician. Born in prosperity, amid refining\\ninfluences; taught Greek and Latin classics; familiar with living poets,\\nscholars and philosophers who frequented his father\\'s house; passing\\na fortnight at the impressible age of eleven in the house of Goethe;\\nimbued with reverence for the character and teaching of his wise Platonic\\ngrandfather, the Jew Moses Mendelssohn, the model for Lessing\\'s \"Nathan\\nthe Wise\"; stimulated by the piquant and genial letters of his three\\ngifted aunts (two of whom had turned Catholic), and above all by the\\ntender, wise, exacting and appreciative oversight of his excellent father,\\nto whom the best was only \"just good enough,\" he grew unconsciously into a\\nlarge and liberal way of thinking. He was at home in the most cultivated\\ncircles, \"a native there, and to the manner born.\" What might it not have\\nbeen to Schubert to have germinated and unfolded under such a genial sun\\nin such a soil! Well was the youth named Felix!\\n\\nMoses Mendelssohn, a little humpbacked Jew peddler boy, with keen eyes\\nand winning face, came to Berlin about the middle of the last century. He\\nhad a hard fight with penury, and an unconquerable passion for knowledge\\nand the culture of his mind. At that time the Jews in Germany were at the\\nlowest stage of social repression. Excluded from nearly all honorable and\\nprofitable pursuits, restricted to Jew quarters, outcast and despised,\\nthey were the chosen victims of Christian intolerance. On the other\\nhand, driven back upon the synagogue, upon the even fiercer bigotry of\\ntheir own priests and rabbis, with whom \"to speak the German language\\ncorrectly or to read a German book was heresy,\" the young man was caught\\nbetween two fires. Yet so brave, so able was he, so faithful to his great\\nlife purpose, and withal so winning by his hearty, sterling honesty of\\nspirit, that he became one of the lights of German literature, one of its\\nrecognized apostles; the intimate associate of Lessing, Herder, Kant, etc.\\nHis conversation had the Socratic quality; and his \"Phaedo,\" a dialogue\\non immortality, founded on that of Plato, was so persuasive that it was\\ntranslated into many languages. He married a Jewess in Hamburg, and grew\\nprosperous as well as learned. He left three daughters and three sons.\\nAbraham, the father of Felix, was the second son, a thriving banker, for\\na while in Paris, when he married Lea Salomon, of the Bartholdy family, a\\nlady of wealth and culture, from Berlin, and formed a partnership with his\\nelder brother in his native Hamburg. Their first child was Fanny, born,\\nas her mother said, with \"Bach fugue fingers.\" The second child, Jakob\\nLudwig Felix, was born February 3, 1809. Before he was three years old,\\nthe French occupied Hamburg, and Abraham fled to Berlin, where he formed a\\nnew banking house, and his whole family were baptized into the Protestant\\nCommunion, taking the added name Bartholdy.\\n\\nThe patriarchal rule, obedience and industry, was strict in the house.\\nBut the father was kind and gentle as well as severe, and Felix loved\\nhim dearly; called him \"not only my father, but my teacher both in art\\nand in life\"; and wondered how it was possible that a father, not a\\ntechnical musician, could criticize the son\\'s early efforts in composition\\nso shrewdly and so justly. After Felix became famous, Abraham said once\\nhumorously of himself: \"Formerly I was the son of my father, now I am the\\nfather of my son.\"\\n\\nThe mother, a lady of fine person, with an air of much benevolence and\\ndignity, was a model housewife; spoke several languages, read Homer in the\\nGreek, played the piano, and gave the first frequent five-minute lessons\\nto her two eldest children, Fanny and Felix. The boy was full of life and\\nfond of out-door play, very attractive with his long brown curls and great\\nbrown eyes. He was frank, unspoiled, earnest in what he undertook, and\\ncould bear no foolish flattery, no nonsense.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S BIRTHPLACE IN HAMBURG.\\n\\nFeb. 3--1809.]\\n\\nAfter a short visit of the family to Paris, in 1816, when Fanny was eleven\\nand Felix seven years old, the children\\'s education began systematically.\\nHeyse (father of the novelist) was their tutor at large; Ludwig Berger,\\nteacher for piano; the strict, conservative Zelter (Goethe\\'s friend) for\\nthorough bass and counterpoint; Henning for violin. Felix, whose pen\\nand pencil sketches in his letters show such a facile gift for drawing,\\nwas taught landscape by Rosel. Greek he learned with his younger sister\\nRebecka, even reading Æschylus. The children were kept closely to their\\nlessons; Felix used to say how much they enjoyed the Sundays, when they\\nhad not to get up at five o\\'clock to work.\\n\\nHe was first heard in a public concert on Oct. 24, 1818, when he played\\nthe piano part in a trio with two horns with much applause. Early in his\\neleventh year he entered the singing class of the Singakademie as an\\nalto. \"There he took his place,\" writes his friend Devrient, \"amongst the\\ngrown people, in his child\\'s suit, a tight fitting jacket cut very low\\nat the neck, and with full trousers buttoned over it. Into the slanting\\npockets of these he liked to thrust his hands, rocking his curly head from\\nside to side, and shifting restlessly from one foot to the other.\"--He\\nspoke French and English fluently; wrote a letter in good Italian; and\\ntranslated the \"Andrea\" of Terence into German verse, besides making such\\ngood headway in Greek. He could ride and swim and dance, right heartily,\\nbut was not fond of mathematics.\\n\\nIn 1820, his twelfth year, he set about composing regularly. With that\\nyear begins the series of forty-four volumes in which he methodically\\npreserved autograph copies of a great part of his works down to the\\ntime of his death, with date and place carefully noted. These are now\\nin the Imperial Library at Berlin. Another proof of his methodical\\nself-discipline is found in the fact that for many years he made it an\\ninvariable rule to compose _something every day_.\\n\\nHis productive activity during the six early years from 1820 to 1826 was\\nincessant, many-sided and prolific. In 1820, among other compositions\\nnamed by Grove, are a Trio for piano and strings; a Sonata for pianoforte\\nand violin; another for pianoforte solo; four organ pieces; a Cantata,\\nbearing the earliest date of all (Jan. 13); a Lustspiel for voices and\\npianoforte, in three scenes, beginning: \"Ich Felix Mendelssohn,\" etc. In\\n1821, five Symphonies for strings, songs, one-act operas. This was the\\nyear when Zelter first took him to Goethe at Weimar.\\n\\nThe next two years were no less productive. In the summer of 1822 the\\nwhole family made a leisurely tour in Switzerland, visiting on the\\nway Spohr at Cassel, on the return Schelble, conductor of the famous\\nCacilien-Verein at Frankfort, and Goethe again at Weimar. Near Geneva he\\nwrote the first (Op. I) of three Quartets for pianoforte and strings. In\\nthe two years six more quartet Symphonies, making twelve in all, which do\\nnot figure in the catalogue, although they were not mere exercises. Then,\\ntoo, an opera, \"The Uncle from Boston,\" in three acts. He was then nearly\\nfifteen, growing fast, his features and expression altering and maturing,\\nand his hair cut short.\\n\\nIt is pleasant to read of the Sunday morning music in his grandmother\\'s\\nlarge dining-room, with a small orchestra, Felix conducting, Fanny\\nor himself at the piano, Rebecka singing, and the young brother Paul\\nplaying the \\'cello. Some composition of his own had place in every\\nprogramme. Noted musicians passing through Berlin were often present.\\nFor critic there was his own father, besides the wise old Zelter. Every\\nevening, also, more or less, the house was enlivened by music, theatrical\\nimpromptus, and \"constant flux and reflux of young, clever, distinguished\\npeople, who made the suppers gay and noisy, and among whom Felix was the\\nfavorite.\" Among the intimates were Moscheles and Spohr.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S FATHER.\\n\\nAbraham Mendelssohn--from a pencil drawing made by his son-in-law William\\nHensel.]\\n\\nA great advance was shown in the compositions of 1824. In the summer\\nFelix, with his father and Rebecka, visited a bathing place on the shores\\nof the Baltic, where he got his first impressions of the sea, afterwards\\nreproduced in the _Meeresstille_ overture. In the next spring father and\\nson were in Paris. There Felix met all the famous French musicians. Their\\ndevotion to _effect_ and superficial glitter, their ignorance of German\\nmusic (Onslow, for instance, having never heard a note of _Fidelio_), the\\ninsulting liberties they took with some of its masterpieces, enraged the\\nenthusiastic lad. With Cherubini his intercourse was more satisfactory. On\\nthe way home they paid a third, short visit to Goethe. The fiery Capriccio\\nin F sharp minor, and the score of the two-act opera, _Camacho\\'s Wedding_,\\nfrom Don Quixote, were fruits of that year.\\n\\nThat summer Abraham Mendelssohn purchased the large house and grounds\\n(ten acres) at No. 3 Leipziger Strasse, which became the sumptuous abode\\nof the family, until the death of Felix, when it was occupied by the\\nHerrenhaus, or House of Lords of the Prussian government. As described by\\nHensel, it was a dignified, old-fashioned, spacious palace, then in the\\nsuburbs of Berlin, near the Potsdam gate, on the edge of the Thiergarten.\\nBehind the house was a court with offices, then gardens and a park with\\nnoble trees,--just the ideal seat for such an artistic family! There was\\na room for large musical parties and private theatricals. Between the\\ncourt and the garden stood the _Gartenhaus_, the middle of which formed\\na hall large enough to hold several hundred persons, with glass doors\\nopening on the lawns and alleys. It was a delightful summer house, but\\nrather bleak in winter. There the Sunday music found new life; there\\nFelix composed the Octet for strings; there, too, in the fine summer of\\n1826, the work with which he \"took his final musical degree,\" astonishing\\nthe world as a full-fledged composer, a master of original, imaginative\\ngenius, the overture to _A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream_. He had been reading\\nwith his sisters the Schlegel and Tieck version of Shakespeare\\'s play. In\\nthis and many instances Fanny, herself a good musician and composer, was\\nher brother\\'s confidante and critic. The fairy vein, which had cropped\\nout in earlier works (the Quintet in A, the Octet, etc.), seemed to have\\nreached its full expression here. And the wonder is that the motives of\\nthe Overture all came in place when he wrote music for the whole play\\nseventeen years later.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S MOTHER.\\n\\nFrom a pencil drawing made by William Hensel.]\\n\\nMeanwhile _Camacho_ was granted one unwilling hearing by Spontini, in the\\nsmaller theatre. Galled by the sneering remarks of the critics, Felix\\nfound the art atmosphere of Berlin more and more antipathetic. Entering\\nthe University of that city, he had less time for composition. How far he\\nfollowed the course does not appear. He attended lectures of Hegel (one\\nof whose courses was on music), and of Ritter, the great geographer. And\\nhe resumed his study of Italian classics, translating into German verse\\nsonnets of Dante and others. There too he became a proficient in landscape\\ndrawing. Ten years later the University of Leipsic conferred on him the\\nhonorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\\n\\nThe life in the new house was very genial and active. Felix practised\\nriding, swimming and other gymnastics with characteristic ardor \"to the\\nutmost\"; for skating he could not bear the cold. And what a brilliant and\\n_elite_ society frequented those large rooms: Rahel Varnhagen, Bettina,\\nHeine, Holtei, Lindblad, Marx, Humboldt, W. Muller, Hegel,--all famous\\nthen or afterwards! Young people were there \"in troops.\" They had a\\nlittle newspaper of their own, called in summer _Garten-Zeitung_, in\\nwinter _Schnee-und Thee-Zeitung_, edited by Felix and Marx, to which\\nall comers were free to contribute; paper, ink and pens lay ready in\\nthe summer-houses. Graver heads, like Humboldt and Zelter, used the\\nopportunity! \"In all this brilliant interchange of art, science and\\nliterature,\" says Grove, \"Felix, even at this early date, was the\\nprominent figure. When he entered the room every one was anxious to\\nspeak to him. Women of double his age made love to him; and men, years\\nafterwards, treasured every word that fell from his lips.\"\\n\\nDuring the next winter, hearing a complaint that Bach seemed like an\\narithmetical exercise, Felix formed a choir of sixteen voices for the\\npractice of the _Passion Music_ at his house. That led to the public\\nperformance of the great neglected master-work a year later; and that to\\nthe \"Bachgesellschaft\" for the stately publication of all Bach\\'s works,\\nnot yet completed. The little choir warmed to the heavenly music, and\\ngrew eager for its public performance, under Felix\\'s own care, by the\\nthree to four hundred voices of the Singakademie, of which Zelter was\\nDirector. Besides the intrinsic difficulty of the music, there were two\\nserious obstacles: the opposition of Zelter, and the apathy of the public.\\nThe first was overcome with the sanguine aid of his friend Devrient,\\nthe actor, who with him faced the lion in his den, and made him finally\\nconsent. The second melted to enthusiasm before the splendid success of\\nthe performance. Felix conducted the rehearsals without notes, knowing\\nthe music all by heart; the leading opera singers undertook the solos;\\nthe public flocked to the rehearsals; and on Wednesday, March 11, 1829,\\nthis greatest choral work of the great old master composer was introduced\\nto the world for the first time since his death. A thousand people were\\nturned away from the doors. Said Felix: \"It was an actor and a Jew who\\nrestored this great Christian work to the people.\" That was the dawn of\\nthe Bach culture, which steadily if slowly gains ground in these our\\nmodern times.\\n\\nIn the midst of this excitement, his gifted, darling sister Fanny became\\nengaged to William Hensel, the distinguished Berlin painter. Mendelssohn\\nhad reached the age of twenty. Not on the best terms with the musical\\nworld of Berlin, he yearned for more congenial air and stimulus. To\\nimprove himself in art and general culture, and \"to make friends,\" he set\\nout on his \"grand tour.\" He arrived in London (April 21), where he was\\nwelcomed by his friends Klingemann (then secretary of legation there)\\nand Moscheles. At the Philharmonic Concert, May 25, he conducted his\\nC-minor Symphony, old John Cramer leading him to the piano, at which in\\nthose days, the conductor sat or stood. The applause was immense, and the\\nScherzo (which he had scored from his Octet, in place of the Minuet and\\nTrio) was persistently encored against his wish. The London reception had\\n\"wiped out the sneers and misunderstandings of Berlin.\" Near the close of\\nhis life he spoke of it as \"having lifted a stone from his heart.\" Indeed,\\nthe English, from that day to this, have been warm, even to the extreme\\nof partiality, in their enthusiasm for the man and for his music. He took\\npart in several other London concerts, was much petted in aristocratic\\ncircles, and disported himself in so many fashionable balls and gaieties,\\nthat the sober family at home became alarmed for him.\\n\\nFrom London to Scotland, where he called upon Sir Walter, and stopped\\nat the Hebrides, sending thence in a glowing letter to Fanny the first\\nmotive of the famous overture which he scored in Rome. Returning to London\\nin September, he was confined to his room two months and could not go\\nhome to his sister Fanny\\'s wedding. In December he found her with her\\nartist husband installed in the _Gartenhaus_ as studio, together with\\nthe Devrients. These, indeed every member of the family took part in the\\nlittle comedy, _Das Heimkehr aus der Fremde_ (\"The Son and Stranger\"),\\nwhich Felix had composed for his parents\\' silver wedding. For Hensel,\\nutterly unmusical, he wrote a part upon one note. That winter he composed\\nhis \"Reformation Symphony.\" A chair of Music was founded expressly for him\\nin the Berlin University, which he knew himself too well to accept.\\n\\nIn May, 1830, the \"grand tour\" was resumed. He reached Weimar on the 30th,\\nspent a fortnight of close intercourse with Goethe, leading what he called\\na \"heathenish life\"; then several very interesting weeks in Munich. Then,\\nthrough the Salzkammergut, to Vienna, where he found Haydn, Mozart and\\nBeethoven ignored in favor of Hummel, Field, and Kalkbrenner; and where\\nhe passed a gay month with musicians, but managed to compose some serious\\nthings.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S SISTER.\\n\\nFanny Mendelssohn--from a pencil drawing made by her husband, William\\nHensel.]\\n\\nThen came the leisurely, long stay in Italy, particularly Rome, of which\\nhis letters give such glowing and minute accounts. There he lived a most\\ngenial and happy life, giving himself up completely to the sunny scene and\\nclimate, to art, and fine churches (of which he found the music dull),\\nold ruins, and all that was picturesque and characteristic in _roba\\ndi Roma_ of all sorts. He was six months in Rome; six weeks in Naples,\\nfinding there his old friend Benedict, whom he first knew as Weber\\'s pupil\\nin Berlin; then Florence, Genoa, Milan and the Italian Lakes. In Italy\\nhe composed the \"Italian\" and \"Scotch\" Symphonies, the _Walpurgisnacht_\\nmusic, and many smaller things. And he filled several drawing-books with\\nsketches. Then, by way of Switzerland, walking from Geneva to Interlachen\\n(all minutely, graphically chronicled in the Letters), to Paris again,\\nwhere he threw himself into the musical and social \"swim.\" But in spite\\nof his warm reception, and the presence of Hiller, Meyerbeer, and many\\nfriends, he found the gay metropolis no more to his taste than before, and\\nwas glad to spend two months again in the \"smoky nest\" of London, playing,\\ncomposing, and publishing.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S WIFE.\\n\\nFrom a pencil drawing by William Hensel.]\\n\\nDuring a second stay in Munich he became \"on a brotherly footing\" with\\nthe very musical family of the Baermanns. For Heinrich Baermann, one of\\nthe finest of clarinet players, he, as well as Weber, composed concert\\npieces. It is his grandson, Carl Baermann, the admirable pianist, who now\\nadds to the musical prestige of Boston. There, too, he brought out his\\nG-minor Concerto (Oct. 17, 1831). And there he was commissioned to compose\\nan opera, and went to Dusseldorf to consult the poet Immermann about a\\nlibretto with Shakespeare\\'s _Tempest_ for a subject.\\n\\nEarly in 1832, his great friends Goethe and Zelter died. Mendelssohn\\nseemed to be the man of all others to succeed the latter at the\\nSingakademie; but he lost the election. As a proof of his wise and noble\\nloyalty to art about this period, read what he wrote to William Taubert\\nfrom Lucerne: \"Don\\'t you agree with me, that the first condition for an\\nartist is, that he have respect for the great ones, and do not try to blow\\nout the great flames, in order that the petty tallow candle may shine a\\nlittle brighter?\"\\n\\nIn May, 1833, his success in conducting the Lower Rhine Festival\\nbrought him an offer to take general charge of the Music in Dusseldorf\\nfor three years at an annual salary of six hundred thalers ($450)!\\nBut his father advised him to accept duties before emoluments. There\\nhe brought out operas by Mozart and Cherubini; and in the church,\\nPalestrina, Bach, Handel, Beethoven: above all _Israel in Egypt_. There\\nhe composed the greater part of _St. Paul_, and his _Melusina_ Overture.\\nSocially Dusseldorf was a delightful place to him; but musically it was\\ndisappointing. In the spring of 1835 he conducted the Cologne Festival.\\n\\nSoon we find him settled (from 1835 to 1844, and again from 1845 to the\\nend of his life) in the most genial home sphere of his artistic labors,\\nLeipsic, where he held the first conductor\\'s post in Europe, at the head\\nof the famous _Gewandhaus_ Concerts. Hardly had he begun his notable\\ncareer there, when he was summoned to Berlin to the death-bed of his\\nfather (Nov. 19, 1835). His grief was profound; for we have seen in\\nwhat respect and love he held him. He carried back to Leipsic two fixed\\npurposes: first, to finish _Paulus_, then to seek a wife. The Oratorio,\\nfor which he selected the words himself, had lain complete before him a\\nyear when it was first given at the Lower Rhine Festival in 1836 with\\ngreat enthusiasm. The wife was found in Frankfurt am Main. It was Cecile\\nJeanrenaud, the lovely seventeen-year-old daughter of a deceased pastor\\nof the Reformed French Church there, who lived with her mother, _nee_\\nSouchay, a highly respected, rich, patrician family of Frankfort. The\\nhappy honeymoon ran over with fun and drollery in their joint diary full\\nof sketches.\\n\\nIn Leipsic his hands were soon full of most congenial tasks: conducting\\nthe _Messiah_; the _Israel in Egypt_, with his own organ part; his own\\n_St. Paul_; besides a series of historical concerts; and composing his\\nForty-Second Psalm, E-minor string Quartet, the D-minor piano Concerto,\\nthe three organ Preludes and Fugues, etc. And is it not worth notice,\\nby the way, that here Mendelssohn commonly shines as the best of\\nprogramme-makers? Indeed, he seems to have been the first in whom that\\nfunction rose to the dignity of an art, when he was not balked by others.\\nCertainly the concerts, (\"academies\") which Mozart and Beethoven gave\\nmostly in noble houses, to make their new works heard, offered no models\\nof good programme-making, containing often far too much of a good thing,\\nsay three great Beethoven Symphonies, with much other matter, in a single\\nevening! The democratic age of concert-giving had not yet come in.\\n\\nIn all this he was strong and happy in the sympathetic companionship of\\nhis young wife, though often torn from her to fulfil engagements at the\\nBirmingham Festival and elsewhere. Thenceforth for several years he gave\\nhis heart and soul to Leipsic, chiefly to the Gewandhaus concerts; he\\nworked with enthusiasm, and was rewarded by the enthusiasm he created.\\n\\nIn June, 1838, he conducted the Cologne Festival, and we have a cogent\\nletter in which he induced the committee to include \"at least one\\nimportant vocal work of Bach\" (a Church Cantata) in the programme,\\nbesides pieces from Handel\\'s _Joshua_. The summer was spent in the dear\\ngarden-house at Berlin; and that was the young wife\\'s first introduction\\nto her husband\\'s family. He kept on composing noble things; among them\\nthe Violin Concerto and a Psalm for eight voices: \"When Israel,\" etc. And\\nhe fell just short of giving the world another Symphony (in B flat). The\\ngreat event of the next Gewandhaus season was the first performance, at\\nthe last concert (March 22, 1839), of the great Schubert Symphony in C. It\\nwas played from the MS., which had been found in Vienna by Schumann.\\n\\nIt would require a volume to detail the programmes of those ten or eleven\\nyears of Gewandhaus concerts under his direction,--to say nothing of\\ngreat musical enterprises outside of all that. In December, 1842, his\\nmother died, and then the Berlin house was his. Yet he lived for the most\\npart in Leipsic, aiding as a professor, with David, Hauptmann, Schumann\\nand the like, in the carrying out of his pet scheme of a Conservatorium\\nof Music. Since 1838 _Elijah_ had been in his mind as the subject of an\\noratorio. It was finished for the Birmingham Festival of 1846. He was on\\nhand there to conduct it, all the world knows with what success. Yet his\\nown fastidious taste saw much in it to alter and polish, and he returned\\nto England for the tenth and last time to conduct it in the revised\\nedition, so to speak.\\n\\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HENSEL.\\n\\nFrom a pencil drawing made by himself.]\\n\\nMeanwhile, near the end of 1840, he was prevailed on to accept a year\\'s\\nengagement at Berlin, and lend his labor and his genius to certain high\\nartistic schemes of king Frederick William IV. Taking leave of Leipsic\\nwith a performance of Bach\\'s St. Matthew Passion Music, he became\\nKapellmeister to the King. The first fruit of that was his noble music to\\nthe _Antigone_, and afterwards the _Œdipus Coloneus_ of Sophocles; and in\\nanother vein, the _Athalie_ of Racine. It was also by the king\\'s request\\nthat he wrote the _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream_ music, into which the early\\noverture fitted as if pre-ordained, and his both beautiful and wildly\\nmelodramatic setting of Goethe\\'s _Walpurgisnacht_. Not far from the same\\ntime he was moved to make an overture, more dramatic than any of his early\\nones, to _Ruy Blas_.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN ON HIS DEATH-BED\\n\\nFrom an English engraving.]\\n\\nOn his last return from England a shadow came over that serene and happy\\nlife. He met the sudden news of his sister Fanny\\'s death, and with a cry\\nfell unconscious to the ground. He sought relief and rest in Switzerland\\nthat summer, painting in water-colors, and playing the organ all alone in\\na little village church--what a touching picture his letters give of it!\\nHis own hour was near at hand. A trouble in his head grew worse. He died\\nin the evening of Thursday, Nov. 4, 1847. He was mourned by all Europe. In\\nLeipsic it was as if the most beloved and honored, the soul and centre of\\nall their higher life and aspiration, were withdrawn. Memorial concerts\\nwere organized in London, Manchester and Birmingham, even in Paris. To\\nthis day among English music-lovers Mendelssohn has been a name to conjure\\nby, adopted as their own like Handel. Mendelssohn scholarships, busts,\\nstatues, became frequent. And a commission was appointed to publish\\nselections from the mass of works he left in manuscript; nor could they\\nkeep pace with the impatient, almost angry outcry (at least in England)\\nfor every scrap of manuscript withheld.\\n\\nMendelssohn stands as the best modern representative of sound, many-sided,\\nconservative, and yet progressive musical culture. He was artist to\\nthe marrow. Gifted with original creative genius--a genius not so deep\\nand absolute, so elemental, so Titanic as that of Bach and Handel and\\nBeethoven, nor of so celestial temper as that of Mozart;--trained to\\nconsummate musicianship through earnest study and personal absorption\\nof the world\\'s great musical inheritance; compelling himself to daily\\nexercise of his own productive faculty, he summed up in himself the\\nrounded whole of musical art down to his own time. He was the ripe\\nmusical scholar. Haunted by original and beautiful ideas, he resisted all\\nextravagant solicitations of the ambitious passion for sensation-making\\nnovelty. He kept within bounds of reason and good taste; he respected\\n\"Terminus, the god of bounds.\" Standing at the height of the musical\\nculture of his age, he won all his triumphs without setting up new\\ntheories, new forms of art, without resorting to questionable ways. He\\nwas nothing if not sincere, frank, simple in his art. Within the approved\\nforms and principles of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, he found free air\\nand scope for the expression of what was in him. He never dreamed of\\nquestioning the validity of absolute, pure music,--music in itself,\\nwithout words or programme. On the contrary, he maintained that music is a\\nlanguage far more definite and less ambiguous than speech; that speech is\\nthe gainer by translation into music, but that music is the loser by any\\nattempt to translate or \"interpret\" it in words.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile autograph letter from Mendelssohn containing\\ncorrections of a four-hand arrangement of one of his symphonies]\\n\\n[Illustration: [Music]\\n\\nFac-simile autograph manuscript of Mendelssohn\\'s most popular song for\\nmale voices, \"Farewell to the Forest\" Composed in 1840.]\\n\\nOf his complete musicianship there is no question. As a performing artist,\\nan interpreter, he was a masterly pianist. We do not measure him by the\\nphenomenal virtuosity of the Liszts, von Bulows, Rubinsteins, and Tausigs,\\nwho came after him. Such comparison would be irrelevant; he was not of\\ntheir kind; not primarily a virtuoso, but essentially an artist and\\ninterpreter. In that sense his playing was remarkable; fluent, brilliant,\\nvital, full of fire and feeling; his touch sensitive, decided, strong or\\ndelicate as the phrase required; his technique free and faultless; its\\nperfection seemed to be spontaneous. Hiller said his playing was what\\nflying is to a bird. Mme. Schumann said: \"Of mere _effects_ of performance\\nhe knew nothing; he was always the great musician; in hearing him one\\nforgets the player in the full enjoyment of the music.\" Joachim says:\\n\"His playing was full of fire, which could scarce be controlled, and yet\\nwas controlled and combined with the greatest delicacy.\" His adherence to\\nstrict time and to his author\\'s meaning is said to have been absolute.\\nHe had a rare faculty of playing at sight from a MS. orchestral score,\\ncharacterizing each instrument by a peculiar quality of tone. He rarely\\nplayed from book, trusting to his prodigious memory. His improvisations\\nastonished all; they were no vague, random excursions over the keyboard,\\nall digression, with which so many flashy finger-knights dazzle their\\naudiences; they were consistent, well-planned compositions, in which\\nthe themes were not merely touched and set in shifting lights, but were\\ncontrapuntally worked and carried out; thematic development was with him a\\nsecond nature. This was partly owing to his early practice in counterpoint\\nunder Zelter.\\n\\nHe deeply loved the organ, and was one of the most masterly organ players\\nand composers of his time. For intrinsic worth and beauty his Organ\\nSonatas rank only next to Bach and Handel.\\n\\nFor conductorship he showed a passion and a gift from boyhood, when he\\nimprovised little private concerts in his father\\'s house. Older musicians\\ndid not disdain to play under his baton. Charming pictures are given\\nby his biographers of the overtures and symphonies, as well as his own\\njuvenile operas, performed there under his enthusiastic lead. Later\\nhe became one of the first conductors living, whether in symphony or\\noratorio. He had the magnetic quality; all the grace and flexibility of\\nhis attractive person, the electric eloquence of look and gesture, made\\neach point of the music felt by performers and hearers. The former never\\ncould mistake his meaning, which was the meaning of the music. We have\\nheard it said by those who knew him, that in the rendering of orchestral\\nmusic, even movements of his own, he was subject to his moods, would take\\nthe same movement at one time much quicker, with more fire than at others;\\nbut it was all genuine, all loyal; there was a reason for it, and the\\nessential music never suffered from this elasticity.\\n\\nHis seemingly instinctive and spontaneous command of counterpoint,\\nalready seen in his improvisation, is manifest in his organ music, in his\\npsalms and oratorios, in his fugues as such, in the clear, symmetrical\\ndevelopment of his orchestral and chamber works, in fact in all his\\ncompositions of whatever form. He was happily at home in this soul secret\\nof the plastic tone-art. For the truth is, he was musically, spiritually,\\na true child of Sebastian Bach: who more fit than he to be the first\\nexponent to our century of the long-shelved Matthew _Passion_ of that\\nmighty master? Through Mendelssohn has Bach gained a foothold in the more\\nmodern world of music.\\n\\nHis instrumentation is a model in its way, neither too much nor too\\nlittle. Never dry and meagre, it is never bloated and excessive, weighed\\ndown to monotony by superfluous multitude of heavy instruments, which give\\neach other scarcely room to vibrate freely, like so much in the \"advanced\"\\ninstrumentation of to-day. It is never extravagant, bent on sensational\\nsurprises and effects, if sometimes droll for cause. It is chaste, simple,\\nclear, while it is vivid, graphic, and expressive. There is no false,\\nexaggerated coloring, only just what suits the subject. Now it is airy,\\ndelicate, and fairylike; now bold, majestic, or sublime; now fraught\\nwith changing atmospheric quality, as in the \"Rain\" chorus in _Elijah_,\\nin the _Hebrides_ overture, and the _Becalmed at Sea_ and _Prosperous\\nVoyage_, now light-hearted and elastic, as in the \"Italian\" Symphony and\\nthe youthful overture to the _Return from Abroad_. If he does not touch\\nthe spiritual depths, nor strike with the lightning suddenness and fire of\\nBeethoven, it is because he is himself, not Beethoven. But alike in his\\npurely instrumental and his choral works, his instrumentation is always\\ninteresting, always clear and telling, and in keeping with the whole,\\nalways original, poetic, full of life and power.\\n\\nWe might discourse upon his mastery of Form. Enough to say, that with him\\nall is in \"good form,\" yet not formal, at least to a fault.\\n\\nSo much of his musicianship, his technical equipment, of what might be\\nlearned from masters. In him it all ministered to a creative genius of an\\noriginal, rare order, as we shall see in a slight, cursory survey of his\\nproductions.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN IN HIS TWELFTH YEAR.[A]\\n\\nPainted by Begas.]\\n\\n[Footnote A: At this age he had written two operas and almost completed a\\nthird,--six symphonies, a quartet for piano and strings, a Cantata, six\\nfugues for the piano, a psalm for four or five voices with a double fugue,\\nand many minor pieces.--K. K.]\\n\\nWe begin with the _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream_ Overture, in which the lad\\nof sixteen sprang into fame a masterly composer. Well had he read his\\nShakespeare,--the bard who fascinates the heart and soul of childhood\\nbefore any child can be supposed to understand him! What a felicitous\\nreproduction of the fairy element in tones! The perfect fairy overture,\\nit is still heard with delight by old and young, and ever will be,\\nit is so fresh, spontaneous, genuine, such an honest emanation from\\nthe enthusiastic heart and imagination of the boy composer. The\\nother movements now commonly sung and played with the drama were the\\nafterthought of Mendelssohn\\'s riper period, when he was thirty-four years\\nold. Schumann says: \"His music is a meditation on the play, _a bridge\\nbetween Bottom and Oberon_, without which the passage into Fairy Land is\\nalmost impossible.\" The same fairy vein, the same dainty elfin motives,\\nor some of the same family, are met in many of the earlier and later\\nworks of Felix. That vein haunted him; it was a lucky string to play\\nupon. Ballad movements, Canzonettas, _Volkslieder_, and the like quaint\\nmelodies, abound as well. The Overture is numbered Op. 21. Sketched or\\ncompleted about the same time were the Octet, Op. 20, the first set of the\\nSongs without Words, and the first Quintet, in A; all works of ripe and\\nfinished art of a clearly asserted, pronounced individuality. These mark\\nthe culmination of his youthful period.\\n\\nHis early piano efforts are in many forms, mostly with strings. He wrote\\nthree Sonatas for piano solo, but soon ceased to cultivate that field (in\\nface of Beethoven?). But he had already opened a new and original field\\nfor himself, albeit a less ambitious one, in the Songs without Words, a\\nfield to which he returned _con amore_ from time to time until late in\\nhis short life. One is tempted to describe some of these choice little\\ntone-poems, were there room; at least the three Gondola Songs. Had he been\\nreading Shelley:\\n\\n    \"My soul is an enchanted boat,\\n    Which like a sleeping swan doth float\\n    Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing.\"\\n\\nThese perhaps express the daintiest, most exquisite of the many moods\\nand themes poetic, sentimental, picturesque, or wideawake and stirring\\nor heroic, in these eight and forty wordless songs. Perhaps the last two\\nsets have not quite the verve of the earlier and more spontaneous numbers.\\nBut think of the _Volkslied_, the hunting and the martial strains, the\\ndeeper meditations, the _Duet_, above all the exhilarating \"Spring Song\"\\nin A! In these, if in nothing else, he opened a new field in musical\\nart, in which many followed him, but none approached him. These _Lieder\\nohne Worte_ are of his most genuine, most individual inspirations. There\\nis hardly a characteristic trait of the composer\\'s style, as developed\\nin his larger works, which you do not find here clearly announced and\\npronounced in these perfect little miniatures. In them we have the whole\\nof Mendelssohn,--we mean of the innate, the essential, not the acquired\\nmusic of the man. If to some they have come to look commonplace, it is\\ntheir own radiance that veils them.\\n\\nOf his many other piano compositions, the most important are the\\nSix Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35; another in E minor, full of fire\\nand strength, his contribution to the Album \"Notre Temps\"; and the\\n_Variations Serieuses_. All the great composers, notably Beethoven, were\\nfond of writing variations. Those of Mendelssohn are full of character,\\nand often figure to advantage in the artistic programmes of pianists. For\\nthe piano with strings, the two Trios are the most interesting, and still\\nchallenge the chamber-concert givers. The two Sonatas with \\'Cello also\\nhold their own.\\n\\nHe loved to employ the piano with orchestra. The brilliant _Capriccio_ in\\nB minor, and the Rondo in E flat, swift as an arrow and going as straight\\nto the mark, are concert favorites; still more the _Serenade_ and _Allegro\\nGiojoso_, full of life and charm. But most important, masterworks indeed,\\nare the two Concertos. That in G minor, by the very fascination of its\\nbeauty, and by being such a model in form, so clear and pure throughout,\\nhas been practised so much in conservatories, and played at the debut of\\nso many callow virtuosos, that a shade of commonplace has settled over\\nit. The other, in D minor, keeps itself more select, so that for the more\\nexacting taste it is publicly too seldom played.\\n\\nAnd, speaking of Concertos, we must not forget the one for the violin,\\nwhich surely ranks only after that by Beethoven, and is attempted by\\nall the violinists. Its charm is never failing. The fine intensity of\\nthe impassioned Allegro has something feminine and far reaching in its\\nquality, so that it was a rare pleasure to hear it interpreted by such\\nan artist as Camilla Urso, with such true nervous grasp and accent. The\\nmiddle movement seemed divine; and the finale, heralded by the brass _ff_,\\nis so uncontainable and full of fire, so brilliant and impetuous, that\\nit admits of being taken at the most rapid tempo. It is perhaps the most\\npopular of all violin concertos.\\n\\nAll the great masters have written string quartets. The Quartet for two\\nviolins, viola and \\'cello, corresponding to the four essential parts\\nin harmony, each maintaining its individuality, yet each essential to\\nthe whole, is the quintessence of musical expression. Any imperfection\\nbetrays itself inevitably; all is exposed; there is nothing hidden\\nunder an orchestral coloring or vague passages of mere effect. The four\\nvoices are four persons. Not to speak of Haydn, father and founder of\\nthe race, the greatest models are those of Mozart and Beethoven. Those\\nof Beethoven often seem like foreshadowings in outline of later phases\\nin his larger grand creations. Those of Mendelssohn are less purely\\nquartet-like. They have more of a singing quality,--a melody with an\\naccompaniment,--and seem to seek orchestral development. The early one\\nin E flat is of highly impassioned character, and might be distinguished\\nas the _Quartet Pathetique_. It has a pathetic introductory _Adagio_,\\nfollowed by a passionate _Allegro_; then a _Canzonetta_, a quaint minor\\nstrain in the spirit of some sad old _Volkslied_ or Ballad; then an\\n_Andante_ of profoundest melancholy; then a bold finale, in 12-8, running\\nin very rapid triplets. The three Quartets of Op. 44 are in a riper\\nstyle. But the first begins with a swift and fiery _Allegro_, of which\\nthe theme is strikingly symphonic, and which has been well said to be not\\nquartet-writing at all, but a melody with a bass and a mere filling-in of\\nmiddle parts; not a conversation between four distinct individualities.\\nThe Mendelssohnian ardor, depth of feeling, yearning aspiration, with\\nall his grace, facility, and clearness, pervade these quartets; but more\\nperfect as quartets are his part-songs for mixed and for male voices. His\\nlast quartet, in F minor, written just after the death of his beloved\\nsister Fanny, so soon before his own, has spontaneous unity in all its\\nmovements. It is said to have been written in forty-eight hours, in one\\nclose closeting with grief.\\n\\nOf the two Quintets, that in A, of the juvenile period, is fresh, bright,\\nfull of life and charm, having a lovely _Andante Intermezzo_, and an\\nelfin _Scherzo_. The much later one, in B flat, by the irrepressible and\\nsoaring impetus of its _Allegro vivace_,--challenge bravely answered in\\nthe _finale_,--by the sad ballad-like _Andante scherzando_ in D minor; and\\nby its profoundly, grandly beautiful _Adagio_, is perhaps more popular and\\nalways welcomed with sincere delight.\\n\\nThere remains the Octet, written just before the Midsummer Night\\'s Dream.\\nIt is not a double quartet, two quartets reinforcing or offsetting\\none another; but it is a conference of eight real parts, eight\\nindividualities. The _ensemble_, especially the fiery opening _Allegro_,\\nhas the richness and fullness of an organ\\'s diapasons, and naturally\\nabounds in contrapuntal imitation to keep eight such parts employed. It is\\nlaid out on the broad scale of a symphony, with great contrast between its\\nseveral movements, especially between the airy-light, crisp _staccato_ of\\nits _Scherzo_ (forerunner of the fairy overture) and the grand sweep and\\nrush, like a freshet, of the _Presto_ finale. The work bears performance\\nby all the strings of an orchestra, and is not seldom so presented.\\n\\nWe come now to his poetic, fascinating Concert Overtures, already ushered\\nin by Shakespeare\\'s fairy wand. Three of these date shortly after the\\nMidsummer Night\\'s Dream. The finest of them is the first, scored in\\nRome a year or two after his visit to the Hebrides, the outgrowth of an\\nattempt to convey to his sister Fanny, in a piano sketch, his impressions\\nof the \"lonely island.\" The overture is often called \"Fingal\\'s Cave.\"\\nIt does not deal in literal description. It is not realistic. It is the\\nfeeling of the scene, subjectively conceived. The leading theme (B minor)\\nsuggests the dreamy reverie of one leaning over the water, absorbed in its\\ncommingling, fluctuating, mystic ebb and flow. The same poetic spirit sang\\nthe _Gondellieder_. In the strong answering motive you feel the wild force\\nof the waves dashing on the rock-bound shores; loud calls give the sense\\nof distance; you hear cries of sea-birds; while all bespeaks the watery\\natmosphere, the solemn silence and the mystic solitude of ocean.\\n\\nThen came _Meeresstille und Gluckliche Fahrt_,--a reproduction as Overture\\nof two sea-pictures from two little poems of Goethe; the first conveying\\nthe sensation of a dead calm at sea; then the rising of a breeze, the\\nboatswain\\'s whistle, the setting of sails and swinging round of the huge,\\nheavy hulk, the addressing itself to motion, making smooth, gallant\\nheadway (with ever and anon great, deep, mysterious sighs!) and entering\\nport amid a triumphal blaze of trumpets. It is a wonderfully graphic\\nand imaginative reproduction of the subjects. The instrumentation is as\\ntelling and artistic as the thematic working. The introduction of the\\npiccolo and of the deep serpent and contrafagotto conveys a sense of\\nillimitable height and depth.\\n\\nThe third, to \"the Fair Melusina,\" Felix tells his sister, he wrote for an\\nopera of Conradin Kreutzer\\'s, based on Tieck\\'s _Mahrchen_, which he saw at\\na theatre. He disliked Kreutzer\\'s music, especially the Overture, which\\nwas encored, and he resolved to write another \"which the people might not\\nencore, but which would cause them more solid pleasure.\" It is romantic\\nmusic in the fullest sense. In the two contrasted themes,--the first (in\\nF) watery, cool and rippling, tempting one beneath the waves,--the other\\n(F minor) chivalric, heroic, proud, impatient,--he clearly had in view\\nthe princess Melusina (supposed to be a mermaid in the hours denied to\\nher lord), and the brave knight who weds her. Schumann says it revives\\n\"those fables of the life deep down beneath the watery abyss.\" How bright\\nand beautiful the mingling colors of the instruments! With what fine\\ncontrapuntal unity in variety the imitation and development proceeds!\\n\\nMore to the humor of to-day, perhaps, is his much later powerfully\\ndramatic Overture to _Ruy Blas_. It is exciting, with bold contrasts,\\nfraught with impending tragic crises, clear, strong, concise, and very\\neffectively instrumented. Not so great as Beethoven\\'s _Coriolanus_\\noverture, it is his nearest approach to that, and shows that Mendelssohn\\nwas capable of something more impassioned, concentrated, fateful, than\\ndreams of fairyland, breathings of sentiment and reproductions of romance.\\n\\nNow for his Symphonies. First, his greatest, in A minor, which is supposed\\nto owe its inspiration to his recollections of Scotland. In its wild,\\ntender, melancholy melody and coloring, its romantic, breezy, sea-shore\\ncharacter, it has affinity with the _Hebrides_ overture. How deep and\\ntender the introductory _Andante con Moto_, 3-4! And how charmingly the\\nkindred _Allegro_ melody, 6-8, sets out from it and runs so smoothly and\\nso rapidly, most of the way in octaves between the first violins and low\\nclarinet tones! How it winds in and out among the instruments, now quiet\\nand individual, now borne along upon the swelling, roaring tide of the\\nwhole orchestra! How it keeps its sweet, sad, minor mood, relieved only\\nby one little bit of sunshiny major! Then, after the repeat, what wild,\\nstrange, sea-shore modulations, the cool, mysterious thrill of ocean and\\nthe Infinite! And when again those shuddering modulations cross the smooth\\nmirror, the excitement swells to a furious climax, and all the strings\\nrush up and down the chromatic scale with a tremendous vehemence; and it\\nall dies down again, till only flutes and reeds are left streaming in\\nthe air, sliding leisurely down tone by tone, and leading back to the\\n_Andante_. Compare this exciting climax with one correspondingly placed in\\nthe seventh symphony of Beethoven; if it has not that Promethean fire that\\ncould defy Olympus, is it feeble in comparison?\\n\\nIn the _Scherzo_ the scene shifts to sunny playfulness. Vividly the\\nlaughing theme leaps out from voice after voice; the instruments seem to\\nspeak, as Schumann says, like men. What hurrying, huddling gleesomeness\\nin the accompaniments, like the tiny waves that crowd up round the spot\\nwhere the fountain\\'s column falls! In hushed _staccato_ the strings\\nwhisper a new motive, which is taken up by all and developed, with\\nfragments of the laughing theme; and there seems to be a pointed allusion,\\nfond and playful, to a characteristic of Scotch melody, in that emphatic\\nmocking of the cadence of a minor third! It floats sportively away, in\\nthe violins, against a skyey background of oboe and horn tones, charming\\nthe soul away with it in pleased forgetfulness, when with a sudden\\nrevulsion of consciousness we are in the minor chord of D (like a great\\nsob, escaping involuntarily), leading with solemn, stately measure and\\na sound of warning into the _Adagio_ in A, 2-4, a most lovely, deep and\\ntender movement, in which the orchestra seems to sing a Psalm of Life....\\nUpon this bursts, like a flash of sunshine over the sombre water, the\\n_Vivacissimo_, a most dashing, brilliant theme, pausing anon to let a more\\npensive melody of reeds be heard; but with rough, impatient vehemence\\nthe basses break off the episode, and the bacchic frenzy of the movement\\nstorms itself away again, until its force is spent, and the quiet naive\\nlittle reed theme gets another chance and runs fondling and chatting\\nalong in duet between bassoon and oboe, and the strain sinks to sleep\\nas in the fairy overture. The short finale, in A major, is in kindred\\nmelody and rhythm with the first _Allegro_, but with a bold and swaggering\\ncarelessness of movement, as of a party breaking up and marching off from\\na glorious carouse, to the tune (at least its spirit) of \"We won\\'t go home\\ntill morning!\"\\n\\nAfter the immortal nine of Beethoven, there is no Symphony more perfect\\nin form than this, of charm more enduring, although we have the great\\none of the \"heavenly length\" in C by Schubert, and such noble ones by\\nSchumann. But Mendelssohn has the advantage over Schumann in point of\\ninstrumentation and of general clearness (the importance of clearness was\\na mooted point between the two friends and mutual admirers).\\n\\nEven more enjoyable in some respects is the \"Italian\" Symphony in A.\\nIt was written earlier than the so-called third, the \"Scotch,\" and is\\ncommonly numbered the fourth. Both were well advanced before he left\\nRome. Its movements are finely contrasted. After the fresh, sunshiny,\\nbuoyant _Allegro_, calling up the blue, blue sky and boundless green of\\nItaly,--brought out all the more vividly by the pensive Mendelssohnian\\nsubjectivity of the low-running _staccato_ of the violins which sets in\\nright after the announcement of the bright first theme,--how impressive\\nis the sombre, solemn, antique-sounding, steady chant of reeds in the\\n_Andante_, with the soft, warm gush of mingling flutes above! It is like\\npassing from Italian noon-day into the rich gloom of some old church. The\\ntranquil, blissful melody of the _Minuet_ flows on in limpid, peaceful\\nbeauty; and the mellow horn Trio makes a delicious episode. In the\\n_Saltarello_ we feel the rush and whirl of Carnival, not without a dash\\nof Mendelssohnian melancholy. The passage from that into the yet wilder\\n_Tarantella_, with its whirling triplets, indicates the very _abandon_ and\\ndelirium of excitement, whereas the former, by the hitch in the alternate\\ntriplet, denotes a dance in which the dancer still keeps some control upon\\nhimself.\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN.\\n\\n    Painted by Th. Hildebrand.       Engraved by E. Eichens.\\n\\nThis portrait was probably made in 1835, Mendelssohn being at that time in\\nhis twenty-sixth year.]\\n\\nThe \"Reformation Symphony\" (No. 5) dates back almost to his juvenile\\nperiod. It was written at the age of twenty-two. With the exception of\\none bright gem, the _Scherzo_, it seems to labor under the proverbial\\nfatality of _occasional_ works. As a Symphony it is exceptional in form,\\nconsisting really of only two parts, with a refreshing interlude between.\\nThe first part, in which the idea of the Old, the frowning Catholic faith,\\npredominates, includes the _Allegro_ with its short _Andante_ prelude. The\\nsecond part, the triumph of the New, with its curious variations on the\\nLutheran Choral, \"_Ein\\' feste Burg_,\" has likewise its short _Andante_\\nprelude, whose rather feeble prayer for peace it answers. Suppose a\\ncurtain dropped between the two parts, while for interlude and recreation\\nwe are vouchsafed that happy _Scherzo_.--But it is hardly fair to count\\nthis early effort into his symphonic period, any more than the Symphony\\n\"No. 1,\" in C minor, which bears date 1824.\\n\\nFrom Symphony to Oratorio we have a noble bridge in the Symphony-Cantata\\n\"_Lobgesang_\" or \"Hymn of Praise.\" It is of later date, to be sure, than\\nthe oratorio _St. Paul_, and was composed to celebrate the invention of\\nthe art of printing, and to lend _eclat_ to the inauguration of the statue\\nof Guttenberg, at Leipsic, June 25, 1840. Many regard it as the most\\nfelicitous and most inspiring of his larger works, although prompted by an\\n\"occasion\"! Praise and gratitude to God for LIGHT; the waiting and longing\\nfor it through the long darkness of the middle ages; then the break of\\nday; the free career and joy of a redeemed humanity; and first and last\\nand everywhere the Praise of God: such were the themes and promptings\\nof Mendelssohn\\'s heart and genius when he composed the _Lobgesang_. The\\nthree orchestral movements which prepare the chorus are essentially\\nsymphonic. From the first trombone proclamation of the pregnant choral\\nmotive, through the rapidly unfolding, fiery, complex _Allegro_; through\\nthe sweet, sad (almost over-sweet) tune (as of \"the heart musing, while\\nthe fire burns,\" yet with a slight flutter) of the middle movement,\\n_Allegretto_, and its alternations with the cheery, choral-like full\\nchords of the wind; to the last deep-drawn sigh of the rich, soulful\\n_Adagio_, it is pure symphony, all leading up to the superb outburst of\\nthe irrepressible chorus of Praise. Thenceforth we breathe the mountain\\nair of oratorio. The work is too familiar to require description. Enough\\nto note the innate strong dramatic tendency of Mendelssohn, as shown in\\nthe middle point and climax of the work, the thrilling scene beginning\\nwith the anxious Tenor recitative; \"Watchman, will the night soon pass?\"\\nwith fitful, wild accompaniment; the startling Soprano answer: \"The night\\nis departing,\" flooding all with instant light; and then the blazing\\noutburst of full chorus, taking up the words in an exciting fugue.--It is\\nsurely an inspired, a master-work, both instrumentally and vocally.\\n\\nOf his two great Oratorios proper,--the greatest certainly since\\nHandel,--the one most esteemed among musicians is the earliest, _St.\\nPaul_, produced in 1836. It shows the influence of Bach throughout, in the\\nfrequency of narrative recitative; in the use made of the Lutheran Choral;\\nin the introduction of turbulent Jewish people\\'s choruses (_turbae_);\\nand in a generally dramatic conception and shaping of the whole. It\\nstands between a Bach _Passion_, and the more epical Handel Oratorio.\\nDepth of religious feeling and great dignity of style pervade the entire\\ncomposition. The music is contrapuntal, never dry and pedantic. The\\noverture is of quite a different character from his concert overtures; it\\nis a solemn, contrapuntal, sacred prelude, with the old-school profundity,\\nyet genial and interesting enough to serve as a good concert piece by\\nitself. The orchestral resources throughout are carefully husbanded,\\nafter the way of Mendelssohn, to the great gain of true and clear\\neffect, affording room for great variety of coloring. He relies on the\\nintrinsic strength of his ideas, rather than on a noisy over-fulness of\\ninstrumentation.\\n\\nThe choruses range from grand, uplifting ones to others very lovely and\\ntender; others mob-like and vindictive, like \"Stone him to death\"; again\\nothers of a vivid local coloring, like those in which the Gentile crowd\\nworship Paul and Barnabas, \"O be gracious, ye Immortals,\" etc., full\\nof light-hearted, sensuous Greek adoration, of \"oxen and garlands\" and\\near-tickling flutes. The arias are characteristic, heartfelt, deeply pious\\nmelodies. _St. Paul_ is the oratorio which is most sure to gain, at every\\nhearing, on a serious and truly music-loving listener.\\n\\n_Elijah_, most popular of oratorios (after the _Messiah_), and most\\nfamiliar, requires even less comment. Description or analysis would bore.\\nThe subject began to occupy his mind in 1838. It was finished for the\\nBirmingham Festival of 1846, where, himself conducting, it was received\\nwith utmost enthusiasm. Yet it did not satisfy himself, and he at once\\nset about revising and polishing. This was but a year before his death.\\nWhen he returned to England for the last time to conduct it, the Prince\\nConsort addressed him as another Elijah \"faithful to the worship of\\ntrue Art, though surrounded by the idolators of Baal.\" In greatness and\\nvariety of poetic and imaginative design, in wealth of musical ideas, in\\nripeness of consummate musicianship, in sure calculation of effects, it is\\na full expression of the composer\\'s genius. It abounds in numbers which\\ncaptivate alike refined and simple listeners. It betrays the dramatic\\nelement in the opening picture of the drought relieved and culminating in\\nthe wonderful \"Rain\" chorus; in the episode of the Widow who has lost her\\nson; in the scene between the Prophet and the wicked Queen; in the Baal\\nchoruses, secular, impatient, boastful, impotently clamoring for miracle;\\nin the sweet soliloquy and meditation of Elijah in the wilderness; in\\nhis ascension in the fiery chariot; and more or less in all the great\\nchoruses, all very graphic. Then what lovely restful choruses, like \"He\\nwatching over Israel,\" followed by the perfect Angel Trio: \"Lift thine\\neyes\"! And arias full of meaning and of exhortation, like the soprano\\n\"Hear ye, Israel,\" in composing which, beginning with the high F sharp,\\nhis mind was haunted by that note as he had heard it in the voice of Jenny\\nLind!\\n\\nJudging from the few fragments published, his unfinished oratorio\\n_Christus_ would have been his greatest sacred composition. From the first\\npart, the Birth of Christ, we have the Trio of the Magi, teeming with\\nwonder and anticipation; then the chorus: \"There shall a star come forth,\"\\nwhich has a sweet, pure, star-like beauty, ending with the choral: \"_Wie\\nschon leuchtet der Morgenstern!_\" From the second part, or Passion, the\\ntenor narratives, the accusing choruses before Pilate, terribly dramatic,\\nespecially the multitudinous echoes of \"Crucify him,\" and the inexorable\\npronunciamento: \"We have a sacred Law,\" bring him into still closer\\naffinity with Bach; and even more so the exquisitely plaintive weeping\\nchorus at the end.\\n\\n[Illustration: Reproduced from Frontispiece to E. Devrient\\'s \"My\\nRecollections of Mendelssohn.\" Sculptor\\'s name not given.]\\n\\nMuch might be said of his one Catholic work, the _Lauda Sion_, composed in\\n1846 for the feast of Corpus Christi at Liege, very beautiful in spite of\\nthe dry dogmatic Latin text, strange text for him! Much, too, of the three\\nMotets for female voices; of the Hymn: \"Hear my Prayer,\" with its soaring,\\nbird-like soprano solo: \"O for the wings of a dove!\" of his masculine,\\nstrong settings of eight or ten of the Psalms, mostly for chorus with\\norchestra, with their Old Testament flavor; and of numerous smaller sacred\\ncompositions.\\n\\nOf course so sensitive a nature, subject to many moods, quick to take\\nimpressions and to turn them into music, was prolific in songs with piano\\naccompaniment. From his earliest composing days, at intervals throughout\\nhis life, he produced sets of _Lieder_ and duets, to the number of\\nninety or more. They are all musical, refined, full of feeling, some of\\nthem strikingly original; but before the few great ones of Beethoven,\\nthe numberless songs of Schubert, those of Schumann, and above all\\nRobert Franz, they retreat into the shade. Yet they have been favorites\\nin musical homes and concert rooms, especially in England, where they\\nintroduced the love of German song, tempting many feeble imitators, while\\nawakening there some worthier responses from the kindred spirit, Sterndale\\nBennett.\\n\\nMore truly original, with more marrow in them, and more of the enduring\\nquality, are his four-part songs, both for mixed and for male voices.\\nThese have been the staple and the best material on which the Liedertafeln\\nall over Germany, and the part-song clubs of England and America have\\nbuilt. After more pretentious, ingenious, sensational part-songs of later\\norigin, it is always refreshing to hear one of them; for they are sincere\\nmusic, thoroughly artistic, with heart and soul and poetry in them. With\\nthem we may mention several larger pieces for male chorus, such as he\\ncomposed to Schiller\\'s Ode \"To the Artists,\" with accompaniment of brass.\\nThe exhortation of the music is worthy of the poem; male choirs feel well\\nwhen they lift their voices in a strain so manly and so edifying.\\n\\nWe come now to a lofty form of choral and orchestral music, which we owe\\nto Mendelssohn. In setting two of the Greek tragedies of Sophocles he had\\nno old Greek music for a model. The spirit of the dramas lay in the text\\nof Sophocles. He had read the _Antigone_ in the Greek, and so far got his\\ninspiration at first hand. He took the suggestion from Frederic William\\nIV., King of Prussia, during a summer residence in Berlin in 1841. The\\npeculiar function of the Chorus in the Greek tragedies, as a mediator\\nbetween the actors and the audience, commenting in some sort of rhythmical\\nchant upon what was passing on the stage, and the sublimity of some of\\nthose choruses, make us feel that there could not have been a truer\\nartistic idea than that of setting them to music, realizing and carrying\\nout their vague embryonic musical aspiration as it could only be realized\\nin these modern times after music had become an art. Mendelssohn\\'s\\ninspiration seems to have sprung congenially from that of Sophocles; and\\nthis music is of the freshest, manliest, most original and vigorous that\\nhe has left.\\n\\n_Antigone_ was the first experiment. He composed it in eleven\\ndays:--Overtures, single and double choruses for male voices, with full\\norchestral accompaniment for all that are lyrical in subject; melodramatic\\nbits, as where Antigone descends into the vault; and chords here and\\nthere making expressive background to the spoken verse. The piece was\\nfirst played on the royal stage at Potsdam; and afterwards on the King\\'s\\nbirthday before a select audience, the venerable Tieck presiding. When it\\nwas given at Leipsic, a meeting of \"learned Thebans\" signed an address\\nto Mendelssohn, thanking him \"for substantially reviving an interest\\nin the Greek tragedy.\" The music has since made its mark everywhere,\\nwhether given on the stage with action, or only sung and played in concert\\nrooms,--at Athens in the original Greek. Nobler men\\'s choruses are never\\nheard than that rich, sweet, pensive moralizing one which sings of man\\'s\\nwondrous faculties and limitations; or that superb hymn to \"Bacchus\"\\n(double chorus),--as full of pomp and splendor as the Wedding March,--in\\nwhich the composer gave free rein to his enthusiasm; or the opening\\ninvocation to \"Helios.\"\\n\\n_Oedipus at Colonos_ he composed at Frankfort in 1844, about the time when\\nhe began to finish _Elijah_, and write the Violin Concerto and the music\\nto _Athaliah_. A favorite with the men\\'s Choral clubs is the chorus which\\nrecounts the beauties of Colonos and the glories of Athens. The music is\\nwonderfully faithful to the ever kindling enthusiasm of the words.\\n\\nThe Mendelssohn Greek choruses are far beyond and above the ordinary\\npart-song, which is a much smaller, humbler affair,--simply, as its name\\ndenotes, a _song_, harmonized in four parts. But these are themes worked\\nup, for single and double choir, with as complete art as the choruses in\\ngreat oratorios, only avoiding the Fugue form, which is Gothic, Christian,\\nsuggestive of the Infinite, not Greek.\\n\\nRacine\\'s _Athalie_, often called his greatest drama, is constructed after\\nthe old Greek model, with choruses similarly employed. Mendelssohn\\'s music\\nfor it, compared with _St. Paul_ and _Elijah_, the _Lobgesang_, or the\\nGreek plays, must to many seem monotonous, in some parts dry and tame. The\\nmusical work, bound by the text, lacks climax. Yet there is much beautiful\\nand some majestic, splendid music in it. Has it a Jewish, as its congeners\\na Greek flavor? The overture is very noble, with the two parts finely\\ncontrasted.\\n\\nDuring the last years of his life the dramatic tendency in Mendelssohn,\\nwhich we have traced all along through so many of his works in many forms,\\nfrom his child operettas in his father\\'s house to the _Walpurgis Night_,\\ngrew upon him with an irresistible momentum. His deep interest in Jenny\\nLind (Goldschmidt), who was his ideal of a singer, and to whom he became\\na most devoted friend, led him as the last musical problem of his life\\nto write an opera for her in which she was to take the principal role in\\nLondon. That was _Die Lorelei_, a theme as legendary and romantic, while\\nmore poetic and more inviting to music, than the monster Norse mythology.\\nThe composition was cut short by his early death. The fragments which he\\nleft of the unfinished work are of such rare excellence, that one wonders\\nwhat might have been, had that ideal been achieved! Might not the German\\ntheatre have then possessed an opera, a lyric drama, which would have\\nforestalled the paradoxical solution of the problem which so many, whether\\nmusical or not, appear so overready to accept? And how long will the\\nfashion hold?\\n\\nGreatly unlike in temperament, in character, in quality of genius, in\\noutward circumstances and environment, largely, too, in their ideal aim\\nand tendency, Mendelssohn and Schumann seem to be destined to be thought\\nof together. They lived at the same time, and were intimate associates and\\nfriends in Leipsic. Each had the warmest admiration for the other. The two\\ntogether were a double morning-star in music; yet \"one star differeth from\\nanother star in glory.\" Opinions will not soon agree which in his works is\\nthe more significant or glorious, which the more potent and far-reaching\\ninfluence. We do not discuss the point. If the sweetness of Mendelssohn\\'s\\nmusic does sometimes cloy; if with all the strength of his orchestral\\nworks, his oratorios and Greek plays, with all the Jewish masculinity\\nof his Psalms, his male choruses and his part-songs, one feels the\\nfeminine, the sentimental minor vein predominate upon the whole; if his\\nstruggles with his formidable art-problems were less Titanic than those of\\nBeethoven, and consequently his triumphs less complete; if his resolution\\nof the discord was a joy less absolute, less wholesome and perennial (for\\nwith Beethoven Joy, joy--_Freude_--is ever the last word,--Joy as of the\\ngods, admitting of no surfeit, no corruption), still there is no denying,\\nexcept by some weak caprice of fashion, the essential greatness of the\\ncomposer Mendelssohn. The most serious deduction to be made is, that he\\nwas to a certain extent imitable. Swarms of imitators sprang up, both in\\nhis own country and in England. Hence a certain sense of sameness began to\\nattach to his music,--a sameness not fairly chargeable to the master, but\\nto the imitators, with whom it was too easy to confound him, or through\\ntheir fog to see him falsely. Well might he have said: \"Save me from my\\nfriends!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: MENDELSSOHN\\'S LAST PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN LEIPSIC.\\n\\nIn the Konigsstrasse.]\\n\\nOnce Mendelssohn was overrated, in a most partisan and partial spirit,\\nespecially in England. Now it is too much the fashion, with young critics\\nand \"disciples of the newness,\" to estimate him far below his real worth.\\nBut all new fashions bring their own reaction. In this case the reaction\\nwill be purifying and salubrious. A reviving interest in Mendelssohn\\'s\\nmusic will be so much new guaranty against all false, extravagant, or\\nmorbid taste.--While music remains music, whatever may be the ups and\\ndowns of fashion, whatever the novelties of style or method, however\\nstartling the juggleries of brilliant execution, the genius and the art\\nof Mendelssohn will still hold good. Their fascination may be lost awhile\\namid the louder clamor of phenomenal new comers; in more sane, reposeful\\nhours, it surely will return with many a sweet surprise. What oratorio\\nsociety, of high aim and standing, can afford to let the _St. Paul_ and\\n_Elijah_, or the _Hymn of Praise_, lose any of their lustre through\\nneglect of frequent practice? What orchestra can fill out a worthy season\\nwithout one or more of his symphonies and of his poetic overtures? Is any\\nproperly ambitious male chorus or part-song club well equipped without\\nthe _Antigone_ and _Oedipus_ music, or the _Ode to the Artists_, or the\\npart-songs of Mendelssohn? Can any chamber music club dispense yet with\\nhis string quartets, quintets, or octet? And where is the pianist, however\\nfar advanced in virtuosity, who does not like to play sometimes his\\ncompositions for pianoforte with orchestra, or who fails to find grateful\\naudience for the _Lieder ohne Worter_? Indeed to ignore all this is to\\nconvict oneself of a very youthful bumptiousness of spirit, an arrogant\\nfanaticism of unreasoning modernness in taste.\\n\\nFour we count above all others in the temple of tone-art and\\ngenius:--Bach, Handel, Mozart and Beethoven. Can we fill out a second four\\nwithout the name of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy? Choice may vary as to one\\nor two names in that second quartet; of Schubert and Schumann there can be\\nno question; some may have preference for Haydn, or for Gluck, or Weber,\\nCherubini, even for Rossini; but when with the other distinctions we take\\ninto account that of many-sidedness, all-round musicianship, can any other\\nfour compete with Mendelssohn except to his advantage?\\n\\n[Illustration: John S. Dwight.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FROM A CAST OF MENDELSSOHN\\'S HAND.]\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT SCHUMANN\\n\\n_Reproduction of an etching by L. Otto, after a Danish photograph. This\\nportrait is preferred by Schumann\\'s family as the most faithful and\\ncharacteristic._]\\n\\n[Illustration: Schumann]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nROBERT SCHUMANN\\n\\n\\nEvery professional musician or music-loving amateur, who examines the\\nindividual influence exerted by our great masters upon himself, should\\nalways hold in especial veneration the name of Robert Schumann. What an\\nimportant factor in our dearest recollections is formed by his music,\\nwhether enjoyed in great orchestral, choral or chamber concerts, or in\\nthe familiarity and reserve of our homes! In how many directions have his\\ncompositions and writings influenced our musical feeling, knowledge and\\ntaste! That which has so early endeared itself to us must necessarily\\nremain a lifelong companion, must, indeed, become a part of our soul;\\nand this particular corner in our musical heart occupied by Schumann\\nconstantly requires fresh recognition of that spirit, which has found\\nexpression in such an enchanting language. Schumann being, however, a true\\nGerman, both personally and artistically, the essence of this spirit is\\nnot readily recognized by foreigners. What the latter admire in him, the\\nGermans love, and if they wish to express that which in Schumann\\'s music\\nis worthy of their highest esteem, they use words for which it would be\\ndifficult to find an exact equivalent in the French, English or Italian\\nlanguages; as for instance, Gemuth, Innigkeit, Sinnigkeit and Schwarmerei.\\nThis is particularly true in the case of his vocal compositions, which\\nsuffer in translation both poetically and musically more than similar\\nworks of any other composer and are for this reason far from being fully\\nappreciated outside of German speaking countries. Schumann\\'s instrumental\\nworks, on the contrary, have made his name famous wherever music has\\nbecome the object of a widespread interest.\\n\\nRobert Schumann\\'s career was not rich in striking events of a general\\ninterest, but it was of a more solitary character, revealing the inward\\nlife of a poetic dreamer whose language was to be music; of an artist who\\npaved the way for a new and brilliant epoch of his art, who enlarged its\\ndomain, fought for its dignity, and by the splendid example of his own\\nproductions proved the possibility of his artistic creed. His works were\\nhis life; in him there was the closest union of man and artist. Just as a\\nknowledge of his life and personal character helps us to understand his\\nmusic, so the study of the latter reveals to us the man, for his works are\\nnot merely results of a natural or an acquired ability, but they form the\\nmusical history of the life of his soul.\\n\\nThe twenty years during which Schumann personally exerted a great\\ninfluence upon the musical world cover a red-letter period of this\\ncentury. Only a few years before, Beethoven, Schubert and Weber had died,\\nclosing the great epoch of the classic masters, while at the same time\\npreparing a new one with new ideals and new prospects. In the centre\\nof the musical world stood the masters of French and Italian opera:\\nAuber, Halevy, Bellini, Donizetti, and soon Meyerbeer, while such men as\\nCherubini, Mehul and Boieldieu had already stepped into the background.\\nGermany still had Spohr and a number of less famous composers excelling\\nin some special field, as for instance, Marschner in opera, Lachner in\\nsong and instrumental music, Lowe in ballads and oratorios, Hummel and\\nMoscheles in pianoforte music; but they all were far surpassed by the\\nbrilliant sun of Mendelssohn which had just risen. He, born in 1809, heads\\nthe list of those distinguished names, which opened a new epoch of our\\nart, mainly represented beside himself by Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Wagner,\\nFranz, and their great French contemporary, Berlioz. Italian and French\\nopera, and an exhibition of meaningless technical virtuosity, formed the\\ngeneral musical taste; Beethoven was neglected, Schubert hardly known;\\nand it looks as if by some kind device of nature just in the right time\\na resurrection of the higher conception of art was brought about, no one\\nassisting more in the great work than Robert Schumann. He was equipped not\\nonly with rarest creative gifts, but also with a superior intellect, a\\nhigh general culture and a thorough and sincere character, which enabled\\nhim to persevere in his great undertaking with unflagging zeal. Alas! why\\nhas not nature been more kind to him? Why has not one so deserving been\\nspared the saddest of all fates? Perhaps it was to make his memory still\\ndearer to us, to increase our veneration for him so that even weaknesses\\nor errors in his life or works elicit from us an honest sympathy, which\\nincreases whenever we read his many published letters or the story of his\\nlife as told by able and sympathetic writers like Wasielewski, Spitta,\\nReissmann, and others.\\n\\nRobert Schumann was born on the 8th of June, 1810, in the town of Zwickau,\\nSaxony. Neither his birthplace, nor his ancestry, were such as to favor\\nan early development of his musical talent. His father, August Schumann,\\nson of a minister, had, after a long struggle between business and poetry,\\nfinally entered into partnership with a brother as a bookseller, and\\nbecame widely known as a publisher of valuable books and magazines, and\\nbesides as an author. He had a particular fondness for English poets,\\nsuch as Milton, Scott, and Byron, whose \"Beppo\" and \"Childe Harold\" he\\ntranslated into German. He was a self-made man, who owed all his success\\nto his own untiring energy. His wife, Johanna Christiana Schnabel, whom\\nhe won only after a severe struggle, was the daughter of the town-surgeon\\nin Zeitz; she is described as an agreeable lady, of kind disposition,\\ndeep feeling and a certain romantic sentimentality, which was also a\\nconspicuous feature of Robert\\'s nature. Her loving care and motherly\\nanxiety for her son is well known to all readers of young Schumann\\'s\\ncorrespondence.\\n\\nRobert was the youngest of five children. His older brothers entered upon\\na business career, and his only sister died in her twentieth year in a\\nstate of incurable melancholy. The handsome little boy was petted by\\neverybody and much surrounded by women. He received his education first\\nin a popular private school, later in the public schools, receiving piano\\ninstruction from a school teacher, Baccalaureus Kuntzsch, when only six\\nyears old. Kuntzsch, who was not a professional musician, at least taught\\nhim the most indispensable elements and was held in highest esteem by\\nSchumann till his death. Little Robert early showed a disposition to lead\\nhis playmates. One particular friend was chosen to assist in four-hand\\npieces and a small boys\\' orchestra was even formed, which Robert directed\\nand for which he made his first efforts as a composer, without having\\nhad any theoretical instruction. There were overtures, even operatic\\nsketches, and especially a setting of the 150th psalm for chorus and\\norchestra, written in Schumann\\'s twelfth year. He also showed a rare\\nskill in improvising on the pianoforte, trying to portray certain persons\\nor dispositions. In public he played the accompaniment of Schneider\\'s\\noratorio \"The Day of Judgment.\" He was very fond of poetry and private\\ntheatricals, but his love of music, which was rapidly increasing,\\nsurpassed everything else. This was particularly noticeable after the\\nsummer of 1819, when he attended a concert given by Moscheles in Carlsbad.\\nThe father had now become convinced that Providence intended Robert for\\na musician, and notwithstanding all the violent objections on the part\\nof his wife, who foresaw nothing but a career full of deprivations, he\\napplied to Carl Maria von Weber, in Dresden, as a teacher for his son.\\nWeber consented to accept Robert as a pupil, but for unknown reasons the\\nexcellent plan was abandoned and the boy\\'s golden opportunity was lost.\\nIn spite of this neglect of early and well directed training (which may\\nexplain why his first compositions were so original in character and\\nstyle), Schumann instinctively kept steadily on in the right path, a fact\\nthat greatly increases our admiration for him. Thus he pursued his musical\\nstudies at home, besides reading as much as possible, and helping his\\nfather in his compilations and translations. But already then he began to\\ngrow more and more reserved and reflective, loving to be alone, in a world\\nof imagination and dreams. That great romanticist and humorist Jean Paul\\nFriedrich Richter had completely enchanted him; he knew his novels almost\\nby heart and never ceased to adore him as the richest source for his own\\nimagination.\\n\\nIn 1826 Schumann met with a severe loss in the death of his father,\\nwho left the responsibility of the lad\\'s future in the hands of his\\nmother and his guardian, the merchant Rudel. They wished him to learn\\nsome profession that would promise a safe position early in life, and\\nobediently submitting, he was inscribed as a law student at the university\\nof Leipsic. Before this he had graduated brilliantly from the Zwickau\\nAcademy and had made a trip to Southern Germany with a friend, visiting,\\namong other places, Bayreuth, where he stopped at Jean Paul\\'s home, and\\nMunich, where he met Heinrich Heine.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT SCHUMANN\\'S BIRTHPLACE IN ZWICKAU.\\n\\nFrom an engraving by A. Krausse, in Leipsic.]\\n\\nThe young law student had not been long in Leipsic, when he began to\\nthoroughly dislike the chosen profession as well as the noisy student\\nlife. To the enthusiastic admirer of Beethoven, Schubert, Jean Paul and\\nShakespeare the law seemed utterly dry and uninteresting. However he\\npromised his guardian that he would pursue his legal studies, although\\nstrong signs of a melancholy disposition had begun to make their\\nappearance. He joined some students\\' societies, but preferred the company\\nof a few friends who were also much given to musical and poetic dreamings.\\nIn the house of Professor Carus, whose wife was a clever singer, his\\nmusical penchant found all desired satisfaction; here he met Marschner\\nand Friedrich Wieck, the eminent piano teacher, father of that wonderful\\nlittle Clara who, then nine years old, had already become famous as a\\npiano-player of rare ability. With his mother\\'s consent Schumann became\\nWieck\\'s pupil, enjoying at last a rational method of technical education,\\nthough still neglecting and even despising all theoretical studies. In\\nFebruary, 1829, Wieck\\'s instruction ended, Schumann gaining more time\\nfor ensemble playing. Beethoven\\'s and Prince Louis Ferdinand\\'s chamber\\ncompositions were frequently rendered, but especially the works of Franz\\nSchubert, whose early death in the preceding year had impressed Schumann\\nvery deeply. Bach\\'s \"Well-tempered Clavichord\" never left his piano. Happy\\nin extemporizing all kinds of new melodies and harmonies, controlled only\\nby his musical instinct, he wrote a number of songs and piano pieces,\\nand even a pianoforte quartet, none of which have ever been published.\\nThe law lectures he neglected, but was much interested in those on the\\ngreat German philosophers Kant, Fichte and Schelling. The next year he\\nspent in Heidelberg, that romantic old town so beautifully situated in\\nthe neighborhood of Switzerland and Italy. Here Schumann met the eminent\\npandectist Thibaut; but even this great professor was unable to overcome\\nthe student\\'s aversion for the legal profession. Again music became the\\ncentre of his existence. Life was charming, the time being much occupied\\nby social events and trips which were made to the neighboring towns and\\nvalleys. On these occasions Schumann used to practice on a dumb piano\\neven when riding in a carriage. In the fall he enjoyed a delightful trip\\nto Switzerland and upper Italy, and the spirit in which he describes his\\nimpressions, changing from wit or rapture into melancholy, from admiration\\ninto home-sickness, is very characteristic of his peculiar nature. The\\nstay in Heidleberg was prolonged for another term, which, however, was\\nagain mainly devoted to piano study and composition, it being here that\\nhe composed his first piano pieces. His skill being widely known, he was\\noften invited to parties, appearing also in a public concert, where he\\nplayed variations by Moscheles. The struggle between filial obedience and\\nloyalty to his genius had now reached its climax. At a concert given by\\nPaganini in Frankfort, he was deeply impressed, and resolved to live no\\nlonger in uncertainty. Accordingly in July, 1830, he sent his mother that\\nfamous letter in which he pleads that his future must be devoted to art,\\nand offers to submit unreservedly to the decision of Wieck. To his immense\\ndelight the latter\\'s advice was favorable and removed all doubts and\\nobjections. Thus Schumann returned to Leipsic as an enthusiastic student\\nof his beloved art.\\n\\n[Illustration: From a portrait taken in 1831, Schumann being then in his\\ntwenty-first year. During this year he wrote his opus 2--\"Papillons.\"]\\n\\nOf the four ways in which a musician may shape his practical career,\\nteaching, conducting, playing and composing, Schumann chose the last\\ntwo as being most congenial to him, aiming particularly at the greatest\\npossible virtuosity. He devoted himself to mechanical exercises with an\\nalmost sacred energy, even inventing devices to promote his abilities in\\nshorter time than a natural development would allow. At the same time\\nhe continued composing, and though having no thorough instruction, he\\nfound by his wonderful instinct an adequate form for the expression of\\nhis feelings and ideas, a form which could not be called unmusical or\\namateurish. Indeed in looking to-day at these earlier compositions, we\\nforget that they were written by a man who was only half educated in\\nmusic, and we admire the genius which guided him in finding the truest\\nlanguage for his rich musical nature. But this was not all. His highly\\ncultivated mind, his desire to promote art by every possible means,\\ncompelled him to become also a leading literary champion of its interests.\\nLeipsic was at that time a great musical centre, although the famous\\nepoch only began in 1835, when Mendelssohn was appointed conductor of the\\nGewandhaus Orchestra.\\n\\n[Illustration: CLARA SCHUMANN.\\n\\nFrom an engraving by Weger after a photograph.]\\n\\nBefore this, however, Schumann had to experience a sad disappointment. A\\ngradually increasing lameness of the middle finger of the right hand (a\\nconsequence of his mechanical contrivances) spoiled every hope of his\\nbecoming a virtuoso. In spite of this new obstacle he devoted himself\\nonly the more to composition, and feeling sadly the lack of the necessary\\ntheoretical instruction, applied to Dorn, conductor of the opera, for\\nlessons. During the winter 1832-33 he stayed with his family in Zwickau,\\nwhere, in a concert given by Clara Wieck, he conducted the first movement\\nof an unpublished symphony in G minor.\\n\\nSchumann was fortunate in being so well situated pecuniarily that he was\\nnot obliged to earn his living during the years of the development of his\\ngenius. After his return to Leipsic he studied in private, surrounding\\nhimself with a few talented friends. Not content with their own mutual\\ninstruction in the spirit and beauty of old masterworks, and the\\nenthusiastic appreciation of the productions of younger composers; firmly\\nbelieving in the possibility of a new and brilliant epoch of musical art,\\nthese young men desired to do all in their power to realize their hopes.\\nIn pursuance of this idea they started a magazine, \"Die neue Zeitschrift\\nfur Musik,\" which for many years was destined to exercise a wide influence\\nin Germany. Its principal mission was to plead for a more poetic\\nconception of music, and this cause was presented in an entirely new\\npoetic language. Poetry and prose, reality and fiction were combined in a\\nvery ingenious manner. A society of Davidites was founded, more in fiction\\nthan reality, not confined to a circle of enthusiasts, but comprising all\\nthe old masters as well as those then living, Mozart and Bach as well as\\nBerlioz, Chopin and Mendelssohn. All writers of meaningless trivialities\\nor dry, unpoetic formalities were attacked as \"Philistines.\" In a similar\\nway Schumann combined fiction and reality in this literary occupation by\\nsubstituting for his own individuality three different characters, to\\npersonify the different sides of his nature, Florestan representing all\\nthat was passionate, manly, energetic; Eusebius embracing all that was\\nsweet, tender or imaginative; with the more objective, experienced and\\nreconciling figure of old Raro, acting as moderator of both. Some years\\nbefore this paper was started, Schumann had made his literary debut by\\ncontributions to other magazines, his first work, when he was twenty-one\\nyears old, being that glorious article on Chopin\\'s opus 2, giving a most\\npoetic record of the feeling which the music of the rising genius had\\nawakened within him. His own paper made its first appearance in April,\\n1834, and Schumann, who soon became its sole editor and proprietor, kept\\nthis position until 1844, when he took up his residence in Dresden. That\\nsmall portion of his time which was unoccupied with journalistic work, was\\ndevoted to composing, the fruits being a number of piano works of striking\\noriginality and of a great variety of moods and forms.\\n\\n[Illustration: In German A flat is As, B natural is H, and E flat is Es.]\\n\\nAlthough Schumann\\'s musical and literary occupations laid strong claim to\\nhis time and attention, yet much of his interest was absorbed by affairs\\nof a private nature. For years he had watched closely the development of\\nClara Wieck; but warm as his feelings were for her, there was another\\nyoung woman who for a while took possession of his heart, Ernestine von\\nFricken, daughter of a Bohemian baron from Asch, a name made famous\\nthrough Schumann\\'s \"Carnival scenes,\" which are mostly based on the four\\nnotes corresponding with the letters of that town (also the only musical\\nletters in his own name). This engagement was, however, broken in 1835,\\nand the following years, so rich in musical and literary productions, were\\nalso marked by a continuous struggle for that wonderful artist, Clara\\nWieck, whose name was to become inseparably united with his own. Not only\\nfrom his letters, but also from many compositions, we learn the extent of\\nSchumann\\'s sufferings from Wieck\\'s obstinate refusal to give his daughter\\nto one who had not yet gained a safe position and who was so far known\\nmore as a critic than as a composer. Schumann tried everything to improve\\nhis position, publishing his paper for a while in Vienna but without\\nfinding the desired success, and, after his return to Leipsic, procuring\\nfrom the university of Jena the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy,\\non the ground of his writings and efforts in the interest of art. His\\nstay in Vienna was not without influence on his future development as\\na composer, and it had, besides this, the great result of bringing to\\nlight some of Schubert\\'s finest compositions, especially the symphony\\nin C, which Schumann not only sent at once to Mendelssohn for its first\\nglorious performance, but presented to the world in all its beauty through\\na wonderful article published in his magazine. His doctor diploma, dated\\nFeb. 24, 1840, speaks in the highest terms of his merits as a composer and\\ncritic.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN.\\n\\nFrom an engraving after a daguerreotype.]\\n\\nWith all his efforts and his growing popularity, Schumann could not\\ngain favor in the eyes of father Wieck; only after a long term of legal\\nproceedings were the happy pair united in marriage, their wedding being\\ncelebrated in a church near Leipsic in Sept., 1840. It was a union of\\ngreatest importance not only to themselves but to music. Both were true\\ncompanions in an ideal struggle, true Davidites and priests of art, Clara\\nSchumann not only continuing her career as a splendid interpreter of\\nthe classics of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin and Schumann, but at the\\nsame time tenderly watching over her husband\\'s health and temper, which\\nwas marked by a growing irritability. Honor though it was to be Robert\\nSchumann\\'s wife, it required a great character and supreme devotion.\\nLooking at his happy family life, reading his expressions of gratitude,\\nesteem and love for his wife; hearing those who have seen him play with\\nhis children, once more we say that it is not only the artist, but the man\\nSchumann for whom we feel a deep sympathy and esteem. Yet his disposition\\nwas not wholly free from features of a less agreeable nature. His\\nsensitiveness and taciturnity often made him appear in an unsympathetic\\nlight, or offend those who meant well with him. But this was only a sign\\nof the deep-rooted disease, which developed so steadily and which so early\\nwrecked his mind and body.\\n\\nThe culmination of Schumann\\'s happiness being attained, his creative\\npowers increased wonderfully. Now he felt compelled to confide the music\\nof his soul to the human voice and suddenly appeared as a great master\\nin a new field, by producing a wealth of songs, perfectly original in\\nstyle, form and spirit. Love, of course, plays a prominent but not\\nexclusive part in them. Yet his genius was seeking for still higher fields\\nand larger forms. The following year was devoted to the composition of\\ngreat orchestral works, three symphonies (two of which were published\\nmuch later in different shape) and the first movement of the pianoforte\\nconcerto. In this higher sphere Schumann again proved himself a master,\\nthe first symphony in B-flat, given most successfully under Mendelssohn\\'s\\ndirection, showing his genius at once in the most brilliant light. This\\nfever for composing did not in the least abate in 1842, the year devoted\\nto chamber music, when he wrote the three string quartets, the quintet\\nand quartet for pianoforte and strings, which were unsurpassed by any\\nlater efforts. Far from being exhausted, in 1843 he completed besides\\nthe famous variations for two pianofortes, the great cantata \"Paradise\\nand the Peri.\" It was received most enthusiastically, and its success\\nstimulated him to write a similar work of still higher order, the musical\\nsetting of the most difficult and mysterious scenes from the second part\\nof Goethe\\'s \"Faust.\" Meanwhile he had continued the work for his musical\\njournal, accompanied his wife to concerts in Hamburg and Russia, where\\nhe was highly honored as a composer, and had also filled a position as\\nprofessor for pianoforte and composition at the new Conservatory opened\\nin April, 1843, with Mendelssohn as director. Of this latter work of\\nSchumann little has become known, and from his uncommunicative nature one\\nhas inferred that he lacked the talent of a true teacher. In 1844 he\\nsevered his connection with the Conservatory and with his journal also,\\nand took up his residence in Dresden. Overwork and the exerting musical\\nlife in Leipsic had greatly increased his nervousness and he expected a\\nspeedy recovery in the royal capital, with its lovely surroundings and\\nquiet life. However it took years to fully restore him. Yet in these very\\nyears Schumann wrote his glorious symphony in C, and devoted much time\\nto strict contrapuntal studies, composing several works in this style.\\nHe finally took a more active part in Dresden\\'s social life, keeping\\na friendly intercourse with other musicians, poets and artists, and a\\nsincere interest in the opera, then directed by young Wagner. At that time\\nthe reform of the musical drama was in Dresden the centre of all musical\\ninterests, and Schumann felt a deep desire to solve the great problem in\\nhis own way.\\n\\nWe shall speak below more extensively about his only opera \"Genoveva.\"\\nAlthough it was completed in Dresden, in 1848, it had its first\\nperformance in the summer of 1850, in Leipsic, under his own direction. It\\nwas repeated there a few times, but was undeniably a great disappointment\\nin spite of all its musical beauties. Schumann was deeply affected,\\ndisagreeing entirely with the critics as to the dramatic character of\\nhis work. Much more successful were the first performances of his music\\nto \"Faust,\" presented at the centenary of Goethe\\'s birthday in Dresden,\\nLeipsic and Weimar. Several years later Schumann added more numbers, but\\nthe entire work was given in its present shape only after his death.\\n\\nIn the winter of 1846-47, Robert and Clara Schumann made a trip to Vienna,\\nwhere the latter played her husband\\'s concerto (completed in 1845), and he\\nconducted his first symphony. The Viennese admired her playing but showed\\nfar less appreciation for his music than the North Germans or even the\\nRussians. In 1847, Schumann succeeded Hiller as director of the Dresden\\n\"Liedertafel,\" and in 1848 he started a mixed chorus, which afforded him\\nmore genuine pleasure than the male chorus. With them he gave the Faust\\nmusic, and \"Paradise and the Peri,\" studied Beethoven\\'s great Mass in D,\\nand began to believe in his abilities as a conductor to such a degree,\\nthat when, in 1849, it was rumored that Rietz, Mendelssohn\\'s successor\\nin Leipsic, was going to Berlin, Schumann eagerly applied for the high\\nposition. Rietz, however, remained. During these last years in Dresden,\\nSchumann had finished a large number of chamber works, songs, duets, male,\\nfemale and mixed choruses with or without accompaniment, piano pieces, and\\nthe music to Byron\\'s \"Manfred.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO ROBERT SCHUMANN IN THE BONN CEMETERY.\\n\\nModelled by the sculptor Dondorf.]\\n\\nIn 1850, Hiller again recommended Schumann to become his successor as\\ndirector of the orchestral and choral concerts in Dusseldorf, and a\\ncall being extended, it was readily accepted by the composer. For such\\na work he had neither the natural gifts nor the necessary preparation,\\nhis conducting being hesitating, his way of rehearsing not in the least\\ninstructive. Fluent as was his style in writing, he lacked the gift of\\neasily imparting his ideas. However, he was received with high honors and\\nfor three seasons performed his new duties, also several times taking\\npart in the great vocal festivals. All his works were listened to with\\ndelight; nevertheless it constantly became more evident that he was unfit\\nfor the position, and in 1853 his engagement was not renewed, the decision\\naffecting him deeply. A visit to Leipsic made by the artists in 1852 for\\nthe performance of several novelties, was also rather disappointing, while\\nthe triumphant tour through Holland, at the end of 1853, forms the last\\nsunny period of Schumann\\'s life.\\n\\nIn these years he had composed feverishly, some of the results being\\nsuch great and famous productions as the Rhenish symphony, the cantata,\\n\"the Pilgrimage of the Rose,\" several overtures, ballads for soli,\\nchorus and orchestra, a mass, a requiem, several chamber works, songs,\\nmelodramas and pianoforte pieces. He also planned writing another opera\\non Schiller\\'s \"Bride of Messina\" or Gœthe\\'s \"Hermann and Dorothea,\" or a\\ngreat popular oratorio on \"Luther,\" but was forced to abandon the scheme.\\nHe was happiest amongst his children and was as talkative with them\\nas reticent with others. Yet his old interest in new talents remained\\nunabated and the way in which he encouraged young musicians, such as\\nReinecke, Meinardus, Dietrich, Joachim and especially Brahms, shows him in\\na most amiable light. But all this time that mysterious influence which\\nhad so early affected his mind, was daily gaining in strength. He was\\ntroubled so much by nervousness, a feeling of permanent anxiety, and even\\nby hallucinations, that he became desirous of a medical treatment in a\\nhospital. One night he rushed from his bed to write down a theme just sent\\nto him by the spirits of Schubert and Mendelssohn. Nor was he free from\\nsuperstitions, for instance passionately taking part in the practice of\\ntable moving. On February 22, 1854, soon after dinner, without any warning\\nhe left his house and the society of a few friends, to seek his final rest\\nin the floods of the Rhine. Saved by sailors, he recovered full possession\\nof his faculties only for a few days, in which he wrote one variation on\\nthe theme of that strange night. During the two last years of his life he\\nwas confined in a private hospital near Bonn. There a few friends such as\\nJoachim and young Brahms were admitted to see the beloved master, so sadly\\nafflicted both physically and mentally. His darkened mind became clear\\nonly at rare intervals, when he would sit at the piano, once more seeking\\na musical expression for the strange world of thoughts within him. But\\nsoon all visits from friends were forbidden, and the wife of the great\\ncomposer saw him only to close his eyes and bid him a last farewell. He\\ndied July 2, 1856, only forty-six years old. In Bonn, where he is buried,\\na beautiful monument by Donndorf is erected in his memory.\\n\\nIn appearance Schumann was rather tall and stately, calm and slow in his\\nmovements, the face, with deep, melancholy eyes and rich dark hair, being\\nquite expressive, but seldom betraying the emotions of his soul, the\\nwealth and depth of his imagination or the exquisite wit and humor, so\\noften encountered in his works. Certain odd peculiarities of his personal\\nand artistic character, which became more apparent when his health\\nbegan to fail, can not impair the general impression of his true nature\\nas manifested in the achievements of his happier days. If we remember\\nhow late Schumann entered upon a musical career, how late he enjoyed a\\nthorough theoretical instruction, how much he has also done in the field\\nof literature, how early his health began to be impaired, and at what an\\nearly age he was called away, we are astonished at the mass of his works,\\nso many of them of the widest scope and importance, which place his name\\namong the noblest and greatest masters.\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile autograph letter from Schumann to a lady,\\nthanking her for her soulful singing in one of his concerts.]\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of portion of letter from Clara Schumann to Karl\\nKlauser, thanking him for introducing her husband\\'s music in Farmington,\\nConn., where it was performed before it became known in New York. The\\nmusicians of that period were pleased to call Farmington \"Schumannville.\"\\nHence her greetings to that place, unknown to the Gazetteer of the U. S.]\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nFac-simile musical manuscript of the opening of Schumann\\'s Quintette Op.\\n44. The original is in the possession of J. Brahms.]\\n\\nIn a certain sense Schumann\\'s works may be regarded as a musical\\ncommentary on his life. This is particularly true of his earlier\\npianoforte compositions. Being neither the result of theoretical studies\\nnor the imitation of favorite masters, they were of a surprising\\noriginality, melodically, rhythmically and harmonically, and revealed a\\nnew spirit in a new form in spite of all relationship to Schubert\\'s small\\ncharacter pieces, Beethoven\\'s last sonatas or Bach\\'s polyphonic style.\\nThey were not only new, but bold and full of a higher significance.\\nSchumann was never at a loss for ideas, but, being familiar with every\\nstyle of pianoforte playing from Bach\\'s to Moscheles\\' and Chopin\\'s, and\\naiming at the career of a virtuoso, he wrote from the beginning in a very\\ndifficult style, rich in wonderful new effects and combinations. Sometimes\\nwe find a \"pearl of great price\" hidden beneath a wealth of ornament of\\nunusual beauty, novelty and poetic significance. So peculiar indeed is the\\nstyle of these pianoforte works, that special technical study is required\\nin order to do them justice.\\n\\nLike all our great composers, Schumann frequently makes use of variations,\\nof course not in Henri Herz\\'s manner, but in Beethoven\\'s, creating out of\\none original idea a series of characteristic pieces, strongly contrasted\\nin form and spirit. In Heidelberg, long before his studies with Dorn,\\nhe wrote those on A-b-e-gg, dedicated to a countess of this name, who,\\nhowever, was in reality nothing but a modest, untitled young lady, with\\nwhom he had become acquainted at a ball. The Impromptu (Op. 5), on a theme\\nof Clara Wieck, belongs to this class also. But of much greater importance\\nare the two works, in which he best showed the peculiar character of his\\npianoforte virtuosity, the Symphonic Studies (Op. 13) and the Andante\\nwith variations for two pianofortes (Op. 46). The extremely interesting\\ntreatment in these works is very free, but always ingenious, and the\\ntechnical and intellectual difficulties are very great.\\n\\nRarely one meets with a long cantilena, in Schumann\\'s earlier works,\\nthe material generally having a short, somewhat fragmentary character,\\noften consisting of but a few notes, though treated with a wealth of\\nrhythmical or harmonical combinations. There is also a great variety of\\nmoods, and the contrasts are not only very distinct, but often unexpected\\nand sudden. As a dreamer full of sweetest or saddest thoughts he is not\\nless touching than as a musical knight of the most chivalrous spirit or\\nas a humorist such as Beethoven. Nowhere can one find a finer exhibition\\nof that peculiar German humor which \"laughs through tears,\" than in\\nSchumann\\'s charming \"Humoreske\" (Op. 20). The arrangements of the Paganini\\ncaprices and studies have a more pedagogic purpose, while the great\\nToccata (Op. 7) and the Allegro (Op. 8) may be called Schumann\\'s noblest\\ncontributions to the literature of bravoura-pieces. More characteristic\\nof his individuality, however, are those works with which his name as\\na musical poet will always remain especially connected--\"Papillons,\"\\n\"Carnival,\" \"Davidsbundlertanze,\" \"Phantasiestucke,\" \"Scenes from\\nChildhood,\" \"Kreisleriana\" and \"Noveletten.\" Distinct pictures of his\\npoetical imagination form their object, yet it is well to remember the\\ncomposer\\'s emphatic declaration, that the music originated in his mind and\\nwas written down before he even thought of the title, which he afterward\\ngave the composition. Yet so wonderfully appropriate are many of these\\ntitles, that it is often impossible not to perceive their meaning in\\nthe music. What an inexhaustible wealth of musical ideas is hidden in\\nall these productions, how many new rhythmical combinations, how many\\n\"sweetest discords\"! Who has ever understood how to show so much depth\\nof feeling and originality of thought, such a rich imagination within\\nsuch narrow limits as has Schumann, particularly in the \"Papillons\"\\nand \"Carnival\"! One feels that much of his own life\\'s experience,\\nmuch of the romance of his heart is embodied in this music. Thus the\\n\"Davidsbundlertanze\" are by no means \"dances,\" but the Davidites\\' knightly\\nfights against the Philistines, nor are the \"Kreisleriana\" a portrayal\\nof the eccentric Capellmeister in E. T. A. Hoffmann\\'s tale, but the\\nexpression of Schumann\\'s own enthusiastic, romantic, many-sided nature and\\nof the ever-varying moods of his soul. In the Novelettes he tells us, in a\\nmost pleasing and spirited language, the story of his struggle for Clara\\'s\\nheart. The Phantasiestucke contain veritable gems among modern pianoforte\\nmusic, such as \"Evenings,\" \"Why,\" \"Traumeswirren\" and \"Aufschwung.\" The\\nutmost delicacy of sentiment and fineness of musical expression are found\\nin the \"Scenes from Childhood,\" which are not meant as compositions for\\nchildren, but as musical genre pictures from the children\\'s life. Other\\nfine pieces such as \"Arabeske,\" \"Blumenstuck,\" \"Nachtstucke,\" may be only\\nmentioned, though each deserves a detailed analysis.\\n\\nIn three Sonatas Schumann has attempted to force the wealth of his\\nimagination into an old classic form, but as he had not then perfected\\nhimself in the latter, and besides wrote the single movements at wide\\nintervals, he could hardly be expected to make a complete success. The\\nmaterial is almost crowded, the development often lacks coherence, the\\ndifferent portions are not of equal value; and yet, considering these\\nproductions as free music, we recognize again the composer\\'s vast\\npowers of invention and combination, his passionate energy, delicacy of\\nsentiment and brilliancy of style. Of these sonatas, the one in G minor\\nis generally praised as the best. On a higher plane we place the great\\nfantasia in C, Op. 17, dedicated to Liszt. Here Schumann\\'s imagination was\\nfree from strict formal fetters; the four movements keep one\\'s interest\\nevenly and keenly alive, and, apparently written in hours of inspiration,\\nthey go directly from heart to heart. The earnest, noble character\\nand lofty spirit of this work remind us indeed of Beethoven, to whose\\nmonument Schumann had first intended to contribute it as an \"obolus.\" Its\\ndifficulties are such, that only eminent players are able to master them\\nand make the meaning of the music clear.\\n\\nAmong Schumann\\'s later pianoforte compositions the following are best\\nknown: the lively, fanciful \"Faschingsschwank,\" composed in Vienna during\\nthe carnival; three romances, of which the one in F-sharp is particularly\\nfamous; some fugues and other pieces in strict contrapuntal style; the\\n\"Scenes from the Woods\" (among which is the odd \"Bird as Prophet\"); \"Bunte\\nBlatter\"; \"Phantasiestucke\"; \"20 Album Leaves\" (including the popular\\ncradle song); and \"Gesange der Fruhe\"; \"Three little Sonatas,\" dedicated\\nto his daughters, and the well known \"Album for the Young,\" with its\\nforty-three charming pieces, are certainly among the most valuable works\\never written for children.\\n\\nOf the compositions for four hands none deserves more sympathy than the\\ncharming \"Pictures from the Orient,\" inspired by Ruckert\\'s \"Makamen des\\nHariri,\" certainly in no way inferior to the famous \"Evening Song\" from\\nthe twelve pieces Op. 85, while the elaborate \"Ball Scenes\" and the easier\\n\"Children\\'s Ball\" were written at a later period.\\n\\nThe pianoforte concerto in A minor ranks directly after Beethoven\\'s.\\nIt has a truly symphonic character, especially in the first and last\\nmovements, the orchestra accompaniment being not less important than the\\nbrilliant solo part, while the middle movement, Intermezzo, seems even\\nlike a lovely solo for the violoncello with piano accompaniment. Two more\\nconcert pieces for pianoforte with orchestra are an Allegro appassionato\\n(Op. 92) and a Concert Allegro with Introduction (Op. 134), the latter\\ndedicated to Joh. Brahms.\\n\\nWhen, in 1840, Schumann reached the sunshine of domestic happiness, he was\\ncompelled to express his joy in singing, not only in vocal compositions,\\nbut also in his instrumental pieces, which now began to assume a more\\nsustained melodic breadth. He played no instrument besides the pianoforte,\\nand for this reason has often been accused of not fully understanding the\\ntrue nature of string or wood instruments. We admit that occasionally a\\ndesired effect is not well produced, but a thousand instances prove that\\nas a general statement such an accusation is entirely false. There are\\nportions where the composer shows a lack of transparency, but a great many\\nmore are very brilliant and most finely balanced. His use of the strings\\nis certainly effective enough in his chamber works, though the finest\\nresults are obtained in their combination with the pianoforte.\\n\\nThe three string quartets dedicated to Mendelssohn show the latter\\'s great\\ninfluence on Schumann\\'s progress in larger forms. Later the composer\\nchanged many details, and now we class them among the most valuable\\nproductions of the kind since Beethoven\\'s death, the beauty of the ideas\\nand their fascinating treatment increasing our admiration with each\\nhearing. Schumann likes to place the Scherzo before the slow movement and\\nto substitute for the Trio an Intermezzo in two-four time. Greater than\\nthese quartets, however, are the famous quintet and quartet in E-flat\\nfor pianoforte and strings. The former especially has been called the\\ngreatest chamber work since Beethoven, and it has not yet been thrust\\nfrom this position of honor. How one would have liked to witness the\\nfirst performance of this splendid work with Clara Schumann, to whom it\\nis dedicated, at the piano! Two very short themes form the basis of the\\nfirst movement, which has a bright, energetic character and received an\\nextremely rich harmonic treatment with a brilliant ornamental figure\\nwork. Then follows a funeral march of a peculiar character, having a\\nchoral-like episode in the major key, and a passionate agitato in F minor.\\nThe highly spirited Scherzo has again two trios, one sweet and melodious,\\nand the other a labyrinth of mysterious sounds and thoughts. The same\\nharmonic wealth and energetic spirit we find again in the Finale, in which\\nthrough a combination of the principal theme with the first one in the\\nopening moment, a grand climax is reached, closing a work which, with all\\nits romantic spirit and modern rhythm and harmony, retains the character\\nof a perfectly classic masterpiece. The pianoforte quartet deserves as\\nmuch praise, one of its most conspicuous features being the close relation\\nwhich Schumann bears to Bach, while retaining his own strikingly modern\\npoetical spirit.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN.\\n\\nFrom a lithograph from life, by Edward Kaiser, in 1847.]\\n\\nThe trios for piano, violin and violoncello in D minor and F are of a high\\norder too, full of ingenious ideas, one being especially interesting by\\nits passionate, poetic spirit, the other through a greater perfection in\\nform; but the originality and artistic perfection which characterize them\\ndo not appear in the G minor trio [Op. 110]. Of a lighter character, yet\\ndelightful on every page, are the \"Phantasiestucke\" for violin, \\'cello and\\npiano, and the \"Marchenerzahlungen\" for piano, clarinet and viola.\\n\\nThe two passionate, melancholy Violin Sonatas of his later years are, in\\nspite of their great musical worth, perhaps more gratifying for players\\nthan for a concert audience, while many an enjoyable page may be found\\namong the different compositions for clarinet, horn, viola, or violoncello\\nand pianoforte.\\n\\nSchumann\\'s organ compositions are few in number, the principal ones\\nbeing the six fugues on B-A-C-H, which differ considerably in value and\\ncharacter.\\n\\nBesides the pianoforte concerto already mentioned, Schumann has composed\\none for violoncello in A minor, demanding a player of great musical\\nintelligence: one for four horns, a revival of the old concerto grosso,\\nand a fantasia for violin with orchestral accompaniment dedicated to\\nJoachim, who owns also the manuscript of a whole violin concerto.\\nAll these works belong to Schumann\\'s last period, showing traces of\\nexhaustion, but still his noble, always purely artistic purposes.\\n\\nIn order to picture Schumann\\'s orchestral works with any degree\\nof justice, we should be gifted with his own wonderful powers of\\ndescription, thus producing upon our readers an impression similar to that\\nproduced by the musical work upon a sympathetic listener. What a splendid\\nprotest are they against the faint-hearted belief, that with Beethoven\\'s\\n\"Ninth\" the symphony as such had not only reached its supreme development,\\nbut died. Surely it required a genius, a great personality, a thorough\\nmaster of the symphonic art to write in this field something worthy of\\nthe great predecessors, and yet original. But such a personality was\\nSchumann, and his symphonies will forever belong to the golden treasure\\nof instrumental music. Far from being imitations in any respect, they\\nhold an independent position of their own and will live as long as their\\ncomposer\\'s name. Already the first one in B-flat appears at once as a\\nmasterpiece of lasting value. In this he might be called a younger brother\\nof Beethoven, a lad with youthful thoughts and hopes and longings, with\\nrosy cheeks and brilliant eyes, full of sweetest tenderness and mirth,\\nbut glowing with youth, manliness and vigor. His kinship with Schubert is\\noften apparent too, although he always shows his own peculiar face. In\\nregard to the form, he introduces many new features.\\n\\nThis is particularly noticeable in his treatment of the second theme in\\nthe first and last movements, in the use of two trios in the Scherzo, and\\nin the melodious Larghetto, which greatly resembles his Phantasiestucke\\nfor piano. Throughout, this music is extremely inspiriting; in spite of\\nan occasional lack of clearness in the instrumentation it is powerful and\\nbrilliant or of exquisite delicacy, and its spirit full of love, happiness\\nand spring.\\n\\nThe second symphony in D minor, later revised and published as No. 4, is\\ndecidedly more passionate and concentrated, some of the four movements\\nbeing closely connected, besides having partly a common thematic material.\\nNew also is the slow impressive introduction of the finale and the free,\\nfantasia-like treatment of the second part of the opening movement. In\\nthe place of a broad adagio a lovely romance precedes the Scherzo, which\\nretains its usual shape, and in all four movements the principal key of D\\nis dominant.\\n\\nSchumann\\'s relationship to Beethoven seems however nowhere more\\nconspicuous than in the great symphony in C. It has an eminently virile,\\nstrong and dithyrambic character. The solemn introduction of the first\\nmovement, the conciseness of its first part, the wide scope of the\\nworking-out portion, even the character of the themes, remind us at once\\nof Beethoven\\'s spirit. An extensive, fanciful scherzo with two different\\ntrios in two-four time precedes the beautiful Adagio, which, with its\\nintense feeling, sweet sadness and almost transcendental loftiness,\\ncomes perhaps nearer to Beethoven than anything else in modern symphonic\\nliterature. An exultant finale crowns this truly monumental work. And\\nlet us not forget that it was written in a gloomy period of mental and\\nphysical distress. The deep study of Bach at that time left many traces in\\nthe masterly contrapuntal work.\\n\\nA new world is revealed in the so-called Rhenish Symphony in E-flat.\\nThere Schumann begins at once with the Allegro, the first subject of the\\nmovement bearing a vigorous character with effective syncopations and clad\\nin all the splendor of the full orchestra, the second being a charming\\nmelody in G minor. Omitting the usual repetition of the first part, he\\nextends the working-out portion by new and ingenious combinations of the\\ntwo subjects. Here again we are often reminded of Beethoven. After the\\nbrilliant Coda a lovely intermezzo follows with a sweet, almost popular\\nmelody for the \\'celli, alternating with a lively staccato figure of the\\nstring and wood instruments and a romantic song for two horns, the whole\\nsuggesting perhaps a pleasant trip on the Rhine at sunset. And is there\\nanything more delicate and touching in any modern symphony than the\\nAndante in A-flat, where every instrument seems to have a soul and to\\nsing directly into our inmost heart, now plaintive and sad, now consoling\\nwith an indescribable delicacy of feeling. Still the composer does not\\nhasten to the finale, but puts in another slow movement in E-flat minor\\nin the character of a solemn ceremony (suggested by the installation of\\nthe archbishop in Cologne), highly effective by its spirit, and vastly\\ninteresting by its masterly counterpoint and rich instrumentation. It\\ntouches us like liberty regained from such mysteries when the finale opens\\nwith its brilliant, vigorous theme, and the whole glorious movement fills\\nour hearts with its own enthusiastic spirit. Yet this great work was\\nwritten when Schumann\\'s powers began to decay, and when he was occupied\\nwith many less successful efforts in other musical fields.\\n\\nThe fifth symphonic work, written directly after the first symphony,\\nbut revised and published later under the title \"Overture, Scherzo and\\nFinale,\" has also become a favorite because of its charming, inspiriting\\ncharacter, especially prominent in the scherzo, which is an excellent\\nrevival of the old gigue form.\\n\\n[Illustration: KAPELLMEISTER KREISLER.\\n\\nAn imaginary and fantastic character introduced in various novels and\\nsketches by E. T. A. Hoffman, impersonating a true musician devoted to the\\nhighest ideals in conflict with the banale and frivolous world and ending\\nin insanity. This sketch is by Hoffman himself, showing Kreisler amusing\\nhimself blowing soap-bubbles, seeming to say: \"What is the world after\\nall, but a soap-bubble?\"\\n\\nThe figure of Kreisler and his various moods depicted in Hoffman\\'s novels\\ninduced Schumann to write his Op. 16 Kreisleriana, dedicated to F. Chopin.\\n\\nA prototype of Schumann\\'s own life and sad end.]\\n\\nNotwithstanding Schumann\\'s admiration for Berlioz, his firm belief in the\\nclose relation between poetry and music, and his programmatic tendencies\\nin earlier pianoforte works, it is very significant that he has in all his\\norchestral writing closely followed the path of his great predecessors.\\nHereby he gave great encouragement to still cling to the classic\\ntradition, and to believe in the possibility of a further development of\\nthe symphonic form.\\n\\nEven the master\\'s overtures may be regarded in this light of pure music,\\nalthough they refer to certain distinct objects. They all were first\\nintended as preludes for some drama or festival occasion, such as the\\none on the Rhine-wine song, in which after a long orchestral movement a\\ntenor solo leads over to the popular chorus finale. The overtures to his\\ndramatic works \"Genoveva\" and \"Manfred\" rank highest, and will be dwelt\\nupon later; the others refer to Shakespeare\\'s \"Julius Cæsar,\" scenes of\\nGœthe\\'s \"Faust,\" Gœthe\\'s \"Hermann and Dorothea,\" and Schiller\\'s \"Bride of\\nMessina\"; the last named being particularly worthy of a deep interest and\\nsympathy.\\n\\nOmitting the many songs for children (some of which have a peculiar\\ncharm), Schumann has composed over two hundred works in this smallest\\nform of vocal music, the majority of which were written in the happy year\\nof his marriage. They made Schumann at once a peer of Franz Schubert,\\nand placed him in the front rank of German song composers as the\\nrepresentative of an entirely new style, which has been quite successfully\\nadopted by younger masters. His poetic nature enabled him, so to speak,\\nto repeat the whole process of the poet in the conception and shaping\\nof his work, but as a musician and in the richer and more delicate\\nlanguage of music, and thus to more clearly express the finest thoughts\\nand feelings of the poem. The words are treated very melodiously, but\\nwith a fine sense for correct accentuation. Although the voice retains\\nthe melodic expression of the sentiment, the accompaniment, far from\\nbeing a conventional support, is raised to such importance that it is\\nabsolutely essential to the vocal strain. Thus much that the poet could\\nonly suggest, found a wonderfully distinct musical expression, partly in\\nfine preludes, interludes and postludes, and partly in the details of\\nthe strict accompaniment. Here again, one is surprised at the abundance\\nof new harmonic and rhythmic combinations. These songs demand the most\\nintimate harmony between singer and player and most of them lose greatly\\nby a translation in any other language, as the music is often closely\\nconnected, not only with the thought and sentiment, but with the special\\npoetic diction of the German text. Schumann has sometimes been accused of\\nlacking a thorough comprehension of the human voice; in a certain sense\\nthis may be true, on the other hand one must admit that there are few\\npublic singers who are capable of giving a just rendering of his finest\\nsongs, many of which are besides hardly appropriate for the concert hall.\\n\\nThe master\\'s high culture guided him in the selection of poems, and the\\ngreat representatives of German lyric poetry, Heine, Ruckert, Eichendorff,\\nChamisso, and Kerner, owe a great deal of their popularity to Schumann,\\nas so many of their finest poems have become inseparably connected with\\nhis music. In his several cycles of songs (Heine\\'s and Eichendorff\\'s\\n\"Liederkreis,\" Heine\\'s \"Dichterliebe,\" Ruckert\\'s \"Liebesfruhling,\"\\nto which Clara Schumann has contributed some numbers, and Chamisso\\'s\\n\"Frauen-Liebe und Leben\"), the single numbers are not connected, but their\\ncoherence is often indicated by some other way. Intensity and purity of\\nfeeling, truth of expression for situations or moods of every kind, and a\\nrare harmony between the poetic and musical senses secure to many of these\\nsongs the highest position in this kind of literature. Some have a simple,\\nalmost popular character (particularly those by Burns), others are very\\nelaborate. In ballads (\"Belsazar,\" \"Soldier\\'s Bride,\" \"Two Grenadiers,\"\\n\"Die Rothe Hanne,\" \"Der arme Peter,\" etc.), Schumann has a peculiar style\\nof his own, differing much from that of the great master of German ballad\\nmusic, Loewe, less popular, yet in many ways not less effective. Less\\nhappy perhaps are his later settings of the songs from Gœthe\\'s \"Wilhelm\\nMeister\" and of poems of Elise Kullmann, Queen Mary Stuart and others.\\n\\nMuch could be said of the many delightful vocal duets, varying so much in\\nstyle and spirit, and interesting us so much both in the vocal and piano\\nparts. Yet we can only mention them here, as well as the several important\\nand larger works for solo voices and piano in a cyclic form, such as the\\n\"Minnespiel\" from Ruckert\\'s \"Liebesfruhling,\" the \"Spanische Liederspiel\"\\nand \"Spanische Liebeslieder,\" all of which should be favorite numbers for\\nvocal chamber concerts.\\n\\nNext in our review stand the part songs for mixed, female or male voices.\\nSome of them deserve a place beside Mendelssohn\\'s little masterpieces,\\nothers are almost forgotten or, like the great motet for double male\\nchorus and organ, or the canons on Ruckert\\'s \"Ritornelle,\" are beyond\\nthe sphere of male chorus societies. Few have won a greater popularity\\nthan the \"Gipsy Life\" with piano, triangle and tambourine. Of greater\\nimportance, however, are several works with orchestra, undeservedly\\nneglected, Ruckert\\'s \"Advent\" and \"New Year Songs,\" Hebbel\\'s gloomy\\n\"Nachtlied,\" and especially the touching \"Requiem for Mignon\" from\\nGœthe\\'s \"Wilhelm Meister.\" Less distinction is attributed to the four\\ngreat ballads for chorus, soli and orchestra, Uhland\\'s \"Gluck von\\nEdenhall,\" \"des Sanger\\'s Fluch,\" \"der Konigssohn,\" and Geibel\\'s \"Vom\\nPagen und der Konigstochter.\" By having these ballads arranged in a\\nmore extended, dramatic form, Schumann impaired the work of the poet;\\nmoreover he succeeded only partially in his musical setting, weak portions\\npredominating over the more effective and even fine passages, which\\nare by no means wanting. The Requiem and the Mass, both for chorus and\\norchestra without solos, the latter acknowledged as decidedly superior,\\nwere composed in feverish haste, and give little proof of his ability to\\nreveal his religious feelings by means of great choruses or to adapt his\\nmusic to the Catholic service. In these late years he tried his powers in\\nalmost every field of composition, even applying the melodramatic form to\\npoems, which are recited to a pianoforte accompaniment (\"Schon Hedwig,\"\\n\"die Fluchtlinge,\" \"der Haideknabe.\")\\n\\n[Illustration: CLARA SCHUMANN.\\n\\nFrom a photograph by Hanfstangl, Munich.]\\n\\nThere yet remain several great works which have helped to make Schumann\\'s\\nname immortal. In the poem of \"Paradise and the Peri,\" forming a part of\\nThomas Moore\\'s \"Lalla Rookh,\" Schumann found a subject particularly suited\\nto his individuality, a touching romantic fairy tale with rich Oriental\\nscenery and pictures of strongly contrasted vivid colors. Schumann changed\\nthe poem in some places and made a few additions of his own, but did\\nnot in the least impair its beauty or coherency. The epic portions are\\nattributed to different solo voices and sometimes even to the chorus. The\\norchestral accompaniment is very elaborate, demanding great care for an\\nadequate performance. All these scenes in India, Africa and at the gates\\nof Eden required a sensuous, yet refined instrumentation to portray them\\nin their peculiar colors. Orchestra and the human voice were called upon\\nto furnish the truest and most touching expression for the varied emotions\\nof every number, which might be warlike and thrilling or tender and sweet,\\nexuberant with joy or hopeless with despair, illustrating the charm of\\na blooming scenery or the gloom, suffering and death brought by the\\nplague. The solos demand singers with beautiful, well-trained voices, and\\na thorough comprehension of all the musical and poetic beauties. A more\\nbrilliant and impressive soprano solo part than the Peri does not exist in\\nall concert literature. There are also parts assigned to a second soprano,\\nalto, tenor and two bass voices, the solos alternating with concerted\\nnumbers of extreme beauty. Of the chorus numbers the finales of parts one\\nand three are on a large plan and have a jubilant and highly spirited\\ncharacter. Not less beautiful are the smaller numbers, each so wonderfully\\nadapted to its particular situation and mood. Indeed one cannot speak\\ntoo highly of all this music, and even one who does not sympathize with\\nsome monotonous portions in the third part, or an occasional deviation\\nfrom correct declamation, will admit that this work is indeed the finest\\nrepository of the wealth, beauty and peculiarity of Robert Schumann\\'s\\nmusical genius, in a field in which he has no superior and hardly a rival.\\nIt inaugurated indeed a new form of secular chorus music, more modern in\\nspirit and freer in the whole arrangement than the oratorio proper, more\\ndramatic than the cantata, and of greater refinement than the opera.\\n\\n\"The Pilgrimage of the Rose\" cannot claim a similar high position.\\nArranged for Schumann by Horn after a poem of Pfarrius, it deals with a\\nconventional story of a weakly, sentimental character, in spite of a few\\nhighly poetical incidents, and is unduly extended. Yet the music contains\\na most beautiful chorus for male voices with horns, and charming mixed\\nchoruses for female and mixed voices, their tones being either soft and\\nmellow or as bright and spirited as anything written in much younger and\\nhappier years. The solos are, however, more monotonous, the famous duet\\nof the miller and his wife being one of the few exceptions. It is also\\ndoubtful whether Schumann did right in arranging the original piano\\naccompaniment for a whole orchestra.\\n\\nThe second immortal work, by which Schumann has enriched vocal concert\\nliterature, is his music to scenes from Gœthe\\'s \"Faust.\" Part I. consists,\\nafter the weak overture, of the scenes in the garden, the dome, and before\\nthe Mater dolorosa, from the first part of Gœthe\\'s tragedy; the scene\\nin the garden is distinguished by a peculiarly fine musical dialogue\\nand orchestral accompaniment, that in the dome by the addition of an\\nimpressive Dies iræ. The more important scenes, however, divided in two\\nparts, are from Gœthe\\'s second play: \"Ariel\\'s song in the morning dawn,\"\\n\"Sunrise,\" \"Faust\\'s monologue,\" \"Scene of the four grey women,\" \"Faust\\'s\\nblinding, death and glorification.\" For this mystic poetry Schumann has\\nfound a sublime musical language, which revealed to thousands the beauty\\nof Gœthe\\'s verses, and the hidden meaning of his thoughts. The fantastic\\nscene of the grey women, Faust\\'s farewell song, the dialogue between\\nMephisto and his Lemures, digging Faust\\'s grave, the latter\\'s death\\nfollowed by a wonderful postlude, are extremely impressive. Yet the climax\\nis reached in the half-religious, allegorical third part, where saints and\\nangels sing, amongst them Gretchen as \"una poenitentium.\" Here are true\\ngems of musical sublimity, comparable with nothing else in the works of\\nSchumann or any other composer. The incorporeal world of spirits becomes\\nalmost visible through the music. The final chorus in eight parts shows in\\nits solemn beginning a marvellous mastery of contrapuntal art, while the\\nallegro on the \"eternal womanly\" perhaps in neither of the two different\\nsettings which Schumann has written, fully reaches his high intentions,\\nand is unduly extended. There are many solo and concerted numbers, yet\\nFaust remains the central figure. The sublime music accorded to him makes\\nhis part unique, approaches nearest the Christ in Bach\\'s \"Passion,\" and\\ndemands a noble voice, technical perfection, and the finest shading in the\\nspiritual expression of every phrase. The orchestral part, too, demands a\\ncareful preparation. Schumann also composed many numbers in which Gœthe\\ndid not prescribe the assistance of music, and if it is true that as a\\nwhole this work has a fragmentary character, one must not forget that\\nSchumann originally intended it for the concert stage, and as such it\\nwill forever remain one of the noblest tasks for great choral societies.\\nHowever it cannot be denied that here too a full enjoyment of all the\\nmusical depth and beauty is only possible in connection with the German\\ntext, with the peculiar melody, rhythm and color of Gœthe\\'s diction.\\n\\nOf a somewhat fragmentary character is also the music to Byron\\'s\\n\"Manfred.\" This dramatic poem with its wealth of thought and almost\\nunbearable gloom was never intended for theatrical purposes; it has\\na kindred spirit with Faust and even with Schumann\\'s own nature, and\\ncertainly no composer could have entered deeper into this poetical\\nglorification of melancholy and despair. Schumann wrote the music under\\nsuch conditions of mind that it could only come from the depths of his\\nheart. The overture ranks among his greatest productions as a highly\\nimpressive picture of a passionate mental struggle, rich in new orchestral\\neffects and finenesses of expression. Besides a lovely entr\\'acte the\\nmany melodramas force even upon those who generally are opposed to this\\nform, the confession that Schumann was one of the greatest musical\\npsychologists; while the few vocal numbers (except perhaps the song of the\\nspirits of Ahrimanes and the Requiem) have less significance. One feels\\nthis especially in theatrical performances, which, although not intended\\nby either poet or composer, impress us still deeper than the usual\\nreading, singing and playing in concert form.\\n\\nAlready in 1842, Schumann had confessed that German opera was the subject\\nof his daily prayer, it being a field in which much could be accomplished.\\nThis longing took a more decided shape in Dresden, where the operatic\\ninterest predominated. There he heard many new and old operas, watching\\nalso the development of him who was destined to become the central figure\\nof modern musical dramatic art. Schumann\\'s relation to Wagner\\'s personal\\nand artistic individuality and his opinion of the latter\\'s earlier works\\ncover a ground on which we hope the future will gain more information\\nthan that afforded by the occasional remarks in Schumann\\'s letters. He\\nhad an irresistible desire to participate in the reform of the opera, and\\nhas shown in his \"Genoveva,\" at least his idea of the best solution of\\nthe problem. He believed honestly in his ability to write dramatic music.\\nAfter searching a long while among old legends and stories, thinking\\nalso of Nibelungen, Wartburg Contest and similar subjects, he decided in\\nfavor of \"Genoveva,\" already treated as tragedy by Tieck and Hebbel.\\nThe painter-poet Reinick was invited to write a libretto, based mainly\\non Hebbel\\'s drama; his book not being satisfactory, Schumann applied to\\nHebbel, who, however, politely declined. The composer, being thus forced\\nto arrange it himself, not only combined the two different plots and\\nstyles of Tieck and Hebbel, but added new features, and omitted others\\nwhich would have greatly increased the sympathy for his play and heroine.\\nMusically he followed Weber in his last operatic experiment \"Euryanthe,\"\\nclosely uniting words, music and action, and connecting the single\\nscenes into one coherent act. But he substituted for the old form of the\\nrecitative the more melodious, but certainly more monotonous, undramatic\\narioso. There are four acts and four principal parts of contrasting\\nindividuality. There is no lack of passionate or tender emotional scenes,\\nof great ensemble numbers, or of scenic display; nor does the lyric\\nelement unduly predominate, but in Schumann\\'s mode of treatment even the\\ndramatic speech assumes a lyric character, and with all the variety of\\nmoods, all the great single effects and the large number of beautiful\\nmusic pieces (prayer, hunting song, love duet, etc.), one does not feel\\nable to retain a hearty, active interest till the end of the last act.\\nInstead of an impressive picture of human passions, sufferings and joys,\\nwe have only a musical illustration of an old story which we liked to\\nread in childhood. Schumann entertained a very high opinion of his work,\\nsaying that it did not contain one bar of undramatic music. He erred, but\\nnevertheless \"Genoveva\" remains a most interesting attempt of one of our\\ngreatest masters to solve the operatic problem, an attempt noble in its\\nsincerity, rich in musical beauty and fine psychological detail, bright\\nin color, yet of more of the style of oil-painting than the al fresco\\nrequired by the stage. Long after the unsuccessful performances in Leipsic\\nthe opera has been revived in many German cities, still finding to-day\\na limited, but highly interested audience of those who love its author\\nfrom his immortal masterworks in other fields. At least the magnificent\\noverture will perpetuate its memory as a favorite concert number all over\\nthe world.\\n\\nThus Schumann has cultivated every field of his art, not with equal\\nsuccess, but always with sincere earnestness of purpose and a noble\\nambition to widen its domain, and to refine its mode of expression.\\nHow original was he in its treatment of melody, rhythm, harmony,\\ninstrumentation, and of the relation of music to poetry, in the\\ncombination of old forms with a new spirit and in his endeavors to find\\nnew forms. Closely connected in spirit and form with Bach, Beethoven and\\nSchubert, he was himself so rich and original that he became a great\\ninfluence upon younger representatives of his art, even on the other\\nside of the Rhine and the British channel, though less so in southern\\ncountries. Some younger composers were particularly successful as his\\nfollowers in some special field, while others showed his great influence\\nin the shaping or coloring of many of their best known and otherwise most\\noriginal productions. His music will be forever an inexhaustible source of\\npure enjoyment for earnest music lovers, and of the most valuable studies\\nfor young aspiring composers of any nationality.\\n\\nThere was however another means by which Schumann exercised a far-reaching\\ninfluence, namely, his literary and critical work. His writings, collected\\nby himself and published in two volumes, belong among the most instructive\\nand enjoyable books on music. Yet one must not forget the time when they\\nwere written. Since then we have become accustomed to many new ideas\\nand names, while many once prominent men and once famous compositions\\nare already forgotten. Still, even if many articles of Schumann are\\ninteresting more in a historical sense, we cannot help being impressed\\neverywhere by his pure, noble, enthusiastic spirit, his high opinion of\\nthe dignity of art, his extensive knowledge of a general character, and\\nby his fine taste and clear judgment. He was as far from cold scientific\\ntheories as from mystic philosophical comprehensions. He was fond of\\nan epigrammatic style, abounding in exclamations and beautiful poetic\\npictures. Indeed there is undeniably a similarity of style between his\\nearlier writings and compositions.\\n\\nSchumann\\'s aim was to promote all high interests of art, a better\\nknowledge of old masters, a loving appreciation of any merits of\\ncontemporaneous composers and the preparation of new fields for coming\\ntalents. How happy is he, when permitted to praise enthusiastically! how\\nrare his ability, to so describe the beauty of a composition that we\\nbecome really acquainted with its form and spirit! Yet he is not always\\nenthusiastic, but sometimes quietly instructive, sarcastic and witty, or\\npassionately angry, as in his one-sided, yet comprehensible attacks on\\nMeyerbeer, Italian opera, or light piano music after the fashion of Herz.\\nBut it shows a generous and noble character that he, a rare productive\\ngenius, found almost his greatest pleasure in discovering new talents;\\nthat even after many years\\' retirement from all journalistic work, he once\\nmore raised his enthusiastic, prophetic voice to introduce Brahms to the\\nmusical world! Nor was he narrow-minded regarding nationality; no Pole\\ncould ever write of Chopin with more enthusiasm, no Frenchman of Berlioz\\nwith a keener appreciation than Schumann did, and how heartily did he\\nwelcome Gade the Dane, Bennett the Englishman, Verhulst the Hollander!\\nHe calls art a fugue, in which all the civilized nations participate\\nalternately. His articles also abound in most remarkable statements of\\na general nature. Of a true work of art he demands a spiritual meaning\\nand a form corresponding to the composer\\'s individuality. \"Music impels\\nnightingales to utter love-songs, pug-dogs to yelp.\" \"An equipped eye\\nsees stars where others only clouds and shadows.\" \"The critic must hasten\\npast those who are sinking and fight for the men of the future.\" He\\nridicules those who \"on a ladder try to measure a colossus like Beethoven\\nwith yard-sticks in their hands.\" In his reviews on new publications he\\nconfined himself to instrumental music, with a few exceptions. The famous\\narticle on Schubert\\'s symphony in C has hardly more lasting value than\\nthe one on Berlioz, with the many significant remarks on the power of\\norchestral instruments for expression and description. But his many high\\npraises of Mendelssohn honor him most. When once told that Mendelssohn\\nwas not true to him, he refused to believe it and always kept his\\nmemory as sacred as that of Schubert. Yet in speaking of their mutual\\nrelations Schumann confessed that he could learn much from Mendelssohn,\\nbut Mendelssohn could also learn something from him, and that, if he had\\nbeen brought up in the same happy circumstances as his contemporaries, he\\nwould surpass them one and all. In Dresden Schumann kept a little theatre\\njournal, in which he wrote short notes on old and new pieces; interesting\\nremarks just like those in \"Meister Raro\\'s, Florestan\\'s and Eusebius\\'\\nDenk- und Dichtbuchlein\" or the well known \"Rules for young people.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN.\\n\\nFrom an engraving by F. Schauer of Berlin, after the medallion in relief\\nby Prof. Rietschel.]\\n\\nAside from all musical interest, one may regard Schumann\\'s writings as\\nvaluable contributions to literature emanating from an author of the\\nfinest artistic sense, a master of his language and of the most wonderful\\nexpressions for the subtleties of poetic or musical feelings. It would\\nnot be right not to mention here his many letters, which so far have\\nbeen published in several collections and which are as instructive for\\nthe musician as enjoyable for the general reader. They help greatly to\\nunderstand his individuality as man and artist. By his literary writings\\nSchumann has perhaps exercised directly and indirectly as great an\\ninfluence as by his musical works. Yet it is the latter, by which he\\nwill live for ever as one who has given his life-blood to his art and\\nenriched our literature by masterworks of absolute beauty, greatness\\nand originality, and who, even where he erred or made unsuccessful\\nexperiments, is worthy of our sincere sympathy because of the honesty\\nof his purpose. Boundless is our gratitude and veneration for him whose\\ngenius will continue to reach thousands of new admirers that will honor in\\nhim a peer of those who are the corner stones of musical art.\\n\\n[Illustration: Louis Kelterborn]\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nFac-simile musical manuscript No. 5 of Schumann\\'s Ritornelles, for male\\nchorus, in Canon form.]\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT FRANZ\\n\\n_Reproduction of a photograph from life, made in 1891, by C. Hopfner of\\nHalle._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nROBERT FRANZ\\n\\n\\nIn the study of the history of musical art, nothing can strike our mind\\nmore impressively than the observation of its coherency, of the connection\\nbetween the different phases in the development of each particular field\\nand between its most prominent representatives; but most striking is this\\nimpression when we become aware of an influence directly felt through\\ngenerations. When about a generation ago the conservative Professor\\nBischoff sarcastically threw the term \"music of the future\" into the\\nworld with reference to Wagner\\'s music dramas, the master accepted it as\\na watchword, and in his pamphlet \"The art work of the future,\" laid down\\nthe hopes and ideals which he strove to realize. Numberless times since\\nthen has this phrase been used everywhere, and those who, standing in the\\nmidst of the movement, wanted to become clear as to its true meaning,\\nhad at least to admit that all great music has ever been \"music of the\\nfuture,\" whether its value has been recognized by contemporaries or not.\\nBut most eminently it has seemed to apply to the great master, Johann\\nSebastian Bach. Of him, who died more than fourteen decades ago, it could\\nhave been said, that only a very remote future would do his works justice,\\nfor even to-day they must still be regarded as \"music of the future,\" and\\nthe influence which they were destined to exert upon the development of\\nmusical art in various fields, is still far from having reached its end.\\nIt is inspiring to see how the thorough understanding and appreciation\\nof this genius, and of the wealth, depth and greatness of his style, are\\nprogressing in the different countries, and just as inspiring to examine\\nhis extraordinary influence upon the more recent epochs of musical\\nhistory. While some composers tried to follow him in his own fields,\\nas Mendelssohn in the oratorio or Rheinberger in compositions for the\\norgan, others, as Schumann and Brahms in instrumental works, have adopted\\nhis wonderful polyphonic and contrapuntal art, showing his influence\\njust in those productions, which otherwise exhibit most strongly their\\nown individuality. Even the revolutionary Wagner held Bach\\'s genius in\\nveneration, and paid a noble tribute to it in his Mastersingers. Indeed,\\nconsidering these facts, an overwhelming sense of admiration and gratitude\\nmust fill our hearts, particularly in thinking of the great master of\\nmodern German song to whom this article is devoted.\\n\\nNot an imitator, but a worthy successor of Bach, in a field, the highest\\ncultivation of which has been preserved to modern time as one of its\\nnoblest tasks, is Robert Franz, whose life and works may perhaps awaken a\\ndouble interest, if viewed in the light of the above introductory remarks.\\nIn outward appearance this life was, perhaps, even more quiet and simple\\nthan that of Bach. Franz\\'s soul and mind had always turned toward the\\ninner world, just as in his songs he studiously avoided all ostentation\\nand meaningless brilliancy. There is indeed a significant harmony between\\nhis life and songs, the latter being the outgrowth of the former, not\\noccasionally written down from a vain ambition to compose, nor as a\\npastime or fashion, but as the fulfilment of his life\\'s task, to which his\\ngenius had committed him.\\n\\nRobert Franz was born June 28, 1815, in Halle, the old university town\\nin the centre of Germany, the birthplace of Handel. Here Franz has\\nremained all his life. He did not descend from a musical family, but from\\nplain, honest, business people; nor were there any direct early proofs\\nof his musical genius, as only in his fourteenth year he was given an\\nopportunity, on an antique, spinet-like pantaleon (or large dulcimer) to\\nmake his first practical experiments, at the same time trying, unaided,\\nwith a touching perseverance, to find out the secrets of musical\\nnotation. However, he had received his first musical impressions when very\\nyoung. At two years of age he had been amply impressed by Luther\\'s choral,\\n\"A Mighty Fortress is Our Lord,\" played by trombones from the steeple of\\na church at the celebration of the third centenary of the Reformation.\\nAt home his father was accustomed to sing the old church and folk songs.\\nThe effect of these early impressions on his young musical soul was soon\\nobvious, for he says that in school he had an irresistible desire to add a\\nsecond voice to the melodies which were being practised. His unsolicited\\nassistance was looked upon as a crime by the teacher, who punished him\\nfor it repeatedly. It was the mother who first lent a helping hand to the\\nboy\\'s outspoken talent and inclination, and who succeeded in persuading\\nhis father to buy the already mentioned pantaleon. Naturally the\\ninstruction which young Robert received, first from a relative and then by\\nnearly all the different music teachers of Halle in succession, was not of\\nmuch value. He achieved more by his own impulses, practising chorals with\\nfriends, eagerly studying the organ and using every opportunity to play\\naccompaniments, as for instance, in the choral rehearsals of the famous\\nFranke Asylum. There he became acquainted with the music of Mozart, Haydn,\\nand his great fellow citizen, Handel, and there he was first fired with\\nthe spirit of composition. Unadvised and without the least theoretical\\npreparation he yielded to his desire to compose, neglecting even his\\nschool duties in favor of this impulse, the results of which, however, he\\nhas declared utterly worthless. It was difficult for him, especially in\\nhis own home, to brave all depreciation of his talents and to overcome all\\nopposition; only the firm belief in his artistic calling enabled him to\\nfight the battle through victoriously.\\n\\nFranz was twenty years old, when at last his parents consented to his\\nthorough professional education. The Leipsic Conservatory not having been\\nfounded, the music school of the famous theorist and composer, Friedrich\\nSchneider, in Dessau, was at that time held in highest esteem, and there\\nFranz was sent. The rather patriarchal, old fashioned, pedantic spirit\\nwhich prevailed in this school, could certainly offer to the young\\naspiring student substantial knowledge, though it could do but little to\\ndevelop his poetic nature. Yet he learned a great deal there, and laid\\na most excellent foundation to the eminent theoretical knowledge and\\nmastery in the strict contrapuntal and polyphonic style by which he later\\nwon such a high distinction.\\n\\nBesides this, the ever fresh impulses of his own nature and the inspiring\\nintercourse with congenial fellow students helped to mature his own\\nmusical individuality. A peculiar influence is attributed to a certain\\nReupsch, whom Franz describes as quite extraordinary in improvisations on\\nthe organ and in the treatment of chorals. Nothing has ever been published\\nof all the works (consisting of pianoforte sonatas, a mass, etc.) which\\nwere composed during these years. Franz felt that his nature would lead\\nhim upon an independent path of his own, but his instinct had not yet\\nfound this sphere. After two years of study he returned home, only to\\nmeet with new opposition and mistrust in his talent. No position was\\noffered him, no compositions appeared in print; and it was then that the\\nsympathy of his faithful mother remained his best comfort. In the circles\\nof cultivated dilettanti he learned that the intrinsic value of a work of\\nart is found in its inner significance, and that its formal value, if it\\nbe a really artistic production, should be a matter of course. This is the\\nvery idea for which Robert Schumann was then fighting, and which men like\\nWagner, Liszt and Berlioz have made the principle of their artistic creed.\\nYet all true art rests on the closest harmony between both elements,\\nwhere the form is the necessary and most perfect expression of the ideal\\ncontents, the two forming a perfect union. What a blessing was it that\\nFranz in this way found rich opportunities to become acquainted with old\\nItalian music, and with the three great German masters, Bach, Schubert and\\nSchumann, whose works have most essentially influenced the moulding of his\\nown musical language.\\n\\nHe gave such close study to their works that his nervous system was\\noverwrought, and becoming his own severest critic he destroyed all his\\nformer compositions. Courage and confidence seemed to leave him and for\\nyears his production ceased. This did not prevent him from striving to\\nacquire a higher general education, however, and he applied himself\\nespecially to the study of philosophy and literature, availing himself of\\nthe rich opportunities afforded by the University of his city. At last a\\nshort dream of love brought forth the music of his soul, his first songs,\\nwhich came forth from the depths of his heart. This was in 1843. Schumann,\\nto whom he sent the songs, honored him with a most hearty recognition of\\nhis talent, and was helpful in finding a publisher. But Franz\\'s nervous\\ncondition and ominous, early developing auricular sufferings obliged him\\nto take an extended trip to Tyrol and Italy. The journey strengthened\\nhim so much that after his return he was finally able to devote with\\nenthusiasm his rich talents untrammelled to the cultivation of his new\\nfield. Others followed Schumann in their sincere recognition of our\\ncomposer\\'s talent, among whom were Gade, Mendelssohn, and especially\\nLiszt, who was so often the noble champion for new talents, and who wrote\\none of his finest pamphlets in praise of Franz\\'s songs. Wagner, who\\ncertainly never could be accused of being too liberal in his praise of\\nothers, was not to be outdone. In a letter to Uhlig he says he will never\\nforget that Franz was, after Liszt, the first German musician who had done\\nhim justice.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT FRANZ.\\n\\nReproduction of an engraving made by A. Weger from a daguerreotype.]\\n\\nBesides some compositions for the church, and a few part songs, Franz has\\nconfined himself to the cultivation of the German \"Lied\" with a wonderful\\nconcentration of all his faculties, reaching the highest perfection,\\nrichness, depth, and beauty in this one _genre_, as Chopin did in his\\nfield of pianoforte compositions. As regards his practical occupation in\\nHalle, he held several positions, with which he had been entrusted soon\\nafter his first success as a composer, being organist at the St. Ulrici\\nchurch and director of the singing Academy and the symphony concerts, as\\nwell as at the University. However, his increasing nervous and auricular\\nmaladies obliged him in 1868 to resign all these offices and to live from\\nthe limited earnings of his compositions. A generous gift in money started\\nby the always noble minded Liszt, and supported by admirers in Germany,\\nEngland and America, released him from all further anxieties. Thus the\\ndear master, invalid in body but young in spirit, lived in retirement\\nin his native city, with his wife, Maria Hinrichs, slowly winning the\\nrecognition of the musical world. Letters received from him in the summer\\nof 1892 still showed an unusually bright and active mind, so that the\\nannouncement of his death, which occurred Oct. 24th in Halle, came as a\\nsad surprise. Many an honor has been conferred upon him, the title of a\\nroyal music director, of an honorary doctor of the Halle University, and\\nBavarian and Prussian orders. Yet greater than all these is the honor of\\nliving forever through his works in the hearts of his people, and in the\\nhigh esteem of all students of music and its history.\\n\\nThe collection of Robert Franz\\'s songs may be well compared to a lovely\\ngarden, most carefully adorned with beautiful flowers of every variety,\\neach of which attracts and deserves our special and close attention.\\nIndeed, whoever takes pains, in an earnest and loving mind to review these\\nsongs one by one, and to penetrate into their peculiar nature, style and\\nbeauty, will be surprised to observe that the composer has allowed not\\none to be published without having perfected it in every detail. Even the\\nsimplest folk-song had to be a true work of art, worthy of his name and\\ngenius, before he would send it upon its wanderings through the world.\\nAnother significant fact, which also does him great credit, is that each\\nsong impresses us most forcibly as being born out of a deep, sympathetic\\ncomprehension of the peculiar genius of the poet, and the language,\\nsentiment, and spirit of the poem. There is no conventionality, no\\nmannerism, no following of certain patterns, which so often characterize\\nancient and modern manufacturers of songs. Every number presents, in\\nclosest harmony with the text of the poem, an individual musical organism,\\nbearing the mark of Franz\\'s artistic individuality, but forming with the\\npoem such a perfect union that we do not wish to separate the music from\\nthe words, nor are we able to fully enjoy either independent of the other.\\nThe music of his songs is not of such a character as to detract from the\\nbeauty and interest of the poem. The musical setting is designed mainly to\\nenhance the charm of the poetic gem, and display it to best advantage.\\n\\n[Illustration: [Music]\\n\\nFac-simile of musical manuscript and letter from Robert Franz.]\\n\\nThere are thousands of songs which please superficial singers and\\naudiences without awakening the least question as to the worth of the\\npoem and its author. This is not true of Franz\\'s songs, however, and\\nnever has a song writer succeeded better than he in doing his chosen poets\\nand poems full justice. He did not use them simply to serve his musical\\npurpose, but adapted himself to them in a way which might be called\\nself-abnegation of the highest form. It is this characteristic, together\\nwith his use of the old contrapuntal and polyphonic art, that gives\\nFranz\\'s compositions a classic aspect. His aim and task was to find a\\nformally clear, distinct expression for every kind of poetical sentiment,\\nand one hardly errs in saying that Franz has outgrown the romanticist\\nin himself and donned the superior garb of classical art. The musical\\nconstruction of his songs is firm and perfectly developed, and allows\\nno room for misunderstanding or individual conceptions. His ideas are\\nexpressed fully and clearly, and although the general impression produced\\nmay continue to move us, it is brought to a complete, satisfactory\\nconclusion by the last note. One feels that here a superior artistic\\nspirit, an eminent musical genius reigns; a genius drawing inspiration\\nfrom the purest musical source, guided by high literary and æsthetic\\nculture, scorning imitation and cheap, tawdry effects, but in each new\\nsong striving for strength, character and perfect harmony with the poet\\nwhose work his music honors.\\n\\nIt will readily be understood why the creator of such beautiful works of\\nart should be unwilling to make the piano accompaniment play a subordinate\\npart. However, he does not raise it to the principal position, as does\\nWagner, in his latest music dramas, but melodically, rhythmically,\\nharmonically, interweaves it with the vocal strain in such a way that each\\npart completes the other, both forming a wonderful unity. In fact, as\\nregards this intimate and organic connection of song and accompaniment,\\nFranz hardly has his equal among the great song composers, notwithstanding\\nmany splendid instances of this combining power found in the songs of\\nSchubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms. Quite often Franz\\'s song\\naccompaniments are written in such a manner that each part forms a\\nbeautiful song by itself, so that one is almost tempted to sing one of the\\ninner voices; while sometimes the accompaniment is even written strictly\\nin four parts, making it seem like a choral composition. This leads us to\\nthe cardinal features of Franz\\'s style, and shows his close relationship\\nto Sebastian Bach and to the already mentioned old hymns and folk songs.\\nAugust Saran has treated this subject most thoroughly in a very remarkable\\nbook culminating in the statement, \"Robert Franz\\'s song is in its whole\\nnature and musical structure nothing else but the old German folk-song,\\nenriched and idealized by the peculiar expressiveness of modern music.\"\\nThose old folk-songs had once reached their highest development on sacred\\nground in the protestant Choral as it became so wonderfully perfected in\\nBach\\'s polyphonic and contrapuntal art. We find that Franz has applied\\nthis same art and spirit to modern lyric songs, although at the same time\\nhe fully recognizes what all the later musical epochs have contributed in\\nthe way of greater delicacy or intensity of expression, richer, and freer\\nuse of the rhythms, new harmonic modulations, a closer regard for the\\nintelligent phrasing of poetic words, and a richer and far more varied and\\neffective technique of the pianoforte.\\n\\nAs regards his style Franz is thus an absolutely modern composer, else\\nhis songs would be mere scholarly experiments, having no inner life. But\\nhis melodies are evidently designed for a polyphonic treatment. They\\nneed to be supplemented by other parts, not merely by a simple chord\\naccompaniment, although this is also used occasionally. Yet with all\\nthese finesses, and the difficulties of such a complicated style, most of\\nthe songs have quite a popular character in the noblest meaning of the\\nword. Only a small number are what the Germans term \"durchcomponirt,\"\\n(composed through), a large majority are in the strophe form. Yet the\\ncomposer understands just how in the most wonderful, scarcely perceptible,\\nand often extremely delicate manner, to do justice to the changing moods\\nof the different strophes. Quite a number of the compositions are true\\nfolk-songs, the poems being old German, Suabian, Swiss, Bohemian and\\nScotch.\\n\\nFranz\\'s favorites among prominent poets, are Heine, Lenau, Eichendorff,\\nBurns and Osterwald, while secondary are Goethe, Ruckert, Geibel, Moricke\\nand Roquette. The subjects treated by him are many and varied; there are\\nmany beautiful songs of nature in various deeply affecting, concentrated\\nmoods, songs of night and stars, of water and waves, weather and storm,\\nautumn and spring, forest and heath; also songs of love in all the phases\\nwhich a heart may experience, from the first sweet, chaste dawn, to the\\nexultation of final happiness; the woe of a broken heart, and of parting\\nand death; nor are merry, dancing or humorous songs missing. Yet there are\\nno ballads.\\n\\nHow many remarkable, strong, or delicate features could be singled out of\\nthis wealth of lyric music, but how much easier and more directly could\\nthis be done with the songs themselves before one! The sharp eye or ear\\nwould then be delightfully surprised by many strange and new details.\\nThey would meet with unusual keys and modulations, intentional indefinite\\nfluctuations between major and minor keys, rhythmical finesses and\\ncurious combinations such as a 7/4 time or the periodical change of the\\ntime, impressive declamatory effects, an effective use of syncopations,\\nsequences, inversions, cadences, characteristic figures and ornaments.\\nAnd this never for purely musical purposes, but for the sake of a better\\nexpression of the poetic meaning. Would that these lines might help to\\ninduce many readers to study closely the songs of Robert Franz! They would\\nthen experience delightful surprises with nearly every song, and their\\nhearts would be filled more and more with music of a new and independent\\nstyle, each tone of which has life and meaning, and helps to arouse one\\'s\\nsympathy for a new, though limited, world of beauty and ideal contents.\\nBut never will the student\\'s surprise and pleasure be greater than when\\nmeeting with songs such as are already familiar and dear to him in other\\nfamous settings. For none of these need to step aside and shun comparison\\nwith their more celebrated rivals. For illustration, his \"Restless Love,\"\\nby Goethe, certainly has not a less passionate melody than Schubert\\'s\\nsetting of the same subject, while the brilliant accompaniment of the\\nformer is decidedly superior to Schubert\\'s. \"When Midnight Dreams\"\\n(\"Allnachtlich im Traume\") is a worthy rival of Schumann\\'s fine song, and\\nmuch better than Mendelssohn\\'s conventional setting of Heine\\'s poem. It\\nis difficult to decide which deserves the preference, Franz\\'s or Brahms\\'\\nsetting of the beautiful slumber-song \"Ruhe Sussliebchen\" from Tieck\\'s\\n\"Schone Magelone;\" though quite dis-similar, both hold high places among\\nthe songs of these two masters. Especially interesting is the comparison\\nof those, the poems of which, mostly written by Heine, have also inspired\\nSchumann to some of his very finest productions. These are the songs\\nwhich are recommended to all who desire to study the strong individuality\\nand significance of Robert Franz as a composer of songs. In such a rich\\ncollection it is impossible to specify the merits of each song; for all\\nappeal equally to our sympathy and attention.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT FRANZ]\\n\\nThe adequate rendering of Franz\\'s songs lies both with the singer and the\\naccompanist. Most of them demand a well trained voice of a fine musical\\nquality, and often of a wide compass, an unusual degree of general musical\\neducation, a clear poetical comprehension of text and music, and a most\\ndistinct enunciation and intelligent phrasing. The accompaniment calls for\\na very clever player, well schooled in Bach\\'s polyphonic style, who has\\na singing tone and who, in the whole conception and delivery, is in full\\nharmony with the singer. Nearly all of these songs can be well rendered\\nand enjoyed in an English translation, if only the translator be guided\\nin his work by the utmost regard for the melos and rhythm of the poem and\\nits music. Franz\\'s songs are still far too little known, although in the\\nold world, and we are proud to say in the new also, some enthusiastic\\nadmirers, singers, musicians and writers have done a great deal for their\\nintroduction. They are everywhere respected, but unduly neglected in vocal\\nconcerts as well as in our homes, where their influence would be felt\\nstill more. May these lines help to win them many true and lasting friends.\\n\\nThere remains still another highly important musical achievement of Robert\\nFranz to be noted,--a series of works through which he has deserved the\\nlasting thanks of all earnest friends of musical art, and which will\\nfor all time connect his name with those of our greatest masters of the\\noratorio, Bach and Handel. Before him Mozart had made a similar attempt\\nwith the music of Handel, and Mendelssohn with that of Bach, but neither\\nachieved a complete success. These old masters did not fully write out the\\naccompaniments to their great works in the form which has become the rule\\nwith their successors, but rather left them as outlines, a mere figured\\nbass indicating the accompaniment, which the composer either played or\\npersonally supervised. The old art of playing from a figured bass has\\nin our time become almost obsolete; besides our ears have through the\\nwonderful development of instrumental music become accustomed to new\\nsounds and orchestral effects, which are now absolutely essential to us.\\nAlso, some instruments have since been discarded and others modified. It\\nwas an extremely difficult task to complete this accompaniment, which was\\nmerely suggested, and arrange it for our modern orchestral instruments,\\nat the same time retaining the spirit and style of the old great masters.\\nIt required a thorough historical and theoretical knowledge, a fine\\nsense of the peculiar character of the different instruments and a\\ncomplete mastery of polyphonic and contrapuntal art, qualities found\\nonly in a true musician, who was himself highly gifted as a composer.\\nScholarly professors might perhaps have performed this feat in a merely\\ncorrect and antiquarian manner, but only a true musician could inspire\\nthese accompaniments with the same life as the old masters would have\\ndone had they lived at the present stage of musical art. It will be\\neasily understood that such an undertaking excited the most animated\\ncriticism, which several times led Franz to defend his standpoint in very\\ninteresting publications. Against such attacks by more or less famous and\\nlearned musical writers he was warmly assisted by enthusiastic friends\\nand admirers in Germany, England and America, where Franz had early\\nfound many marks of a high appreciation of his genius. However the most\\ngratifying reward for his labors is the fact that his arrangements of the\\nold masterworks are steadily coming into general use. Modern as is his\\nsentiment as a productive musician, he stands nearer to Bach and Handel\\nin style and spirit than any other modern composer. We know of none who\\ncould have performed this great task more conscientiously, with a deeper\\ncomprehension of the old art and with a more loving devotion than Robert\\nFranz. What he has achieved in this line secures him immortality not less\\nthan his songs.\\n\\nThe most important of these arrangements are: Handel\\'s \"Messiah,\"\\n\"Jubilate,\" \"l\\'Allegro il Pensieroso ed il Moderato,\" and many arias and\\nduets; Bach\\'s \"St. Matthew Passion,\" \"Magnificat,\" \"Christmas Oratorio,\"\\n\"Tragic Ode,\" and many cantatas and arias; Astorga\\'s \"Stabat Mater,\"\\nDurante\\'s \"Magnificat,\" and quite a collection of old German chorals and\\nsongs.\\n\\nConsidering, then, all that Franz has done for us, we bow in\\nadmiration and thankfulness before a genius, who is one of the noblest\\nrepresentatives of the latest musical epoch, and whose name is one of\\nthe few worthy to continue the list of those masters whom we honor as\\nthe corner stones of musical art. For it is not the size, but the ideal\\nsignificance and degree of perfection, which determines the greatness and\\nlasting value of a work of art. Whoever produces works of absolute beauty\\nand perfection, even in a minor field, deserves a place of honor amongst\\nthe masters of all times.\\n\\n[Illustration: Louis Kelterborn]\\n\\n[Illustration: GIACOMO MEYERBEER\\n\\n_Reproduction of a lithograph portrait made from life by Kriehuber of\\nVienna. Meyerbeer in his fifty-sixth year._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: MEYERBEER]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nGIACOMO MEYERBEER\\n\\n\\nThe great composer known under the name of Meyerbeer, and who occupied\\none of the most important places in the history of musical art in the\\nnineteenth century, was in reality christened Jacob Liebmann Beer, his\\nChristian name being afterward Italianized into Giacomo. He was born at\\nBerlin, according to some authorities on Sept. 5th, according to others\\non Sept. 23, 1791. His father, who was a Hebrew, and one of the richest\\nbankers of Prussia, had three other sons, William, Michael and Henry,\\nall of whom were distinguished men, although their notoriety has been\\neclipsed by the glory of him who is known to the world as Meyerbeer.\\nWilliam Beer, indeed, who succeeded his father as banker, was at the same\\ntime a remarkable astronomer. He became the collaborator of Maedler for\\nhis scientific works, and published a chart of the moon which won for him\\nan important prize from the Berlin Academy of Sciences; he died March 27,\\n1850. Michael Beer, who was born in 1800 and died when only thirty-three,\\nacquired considerable renown as a dramatic poet by his various works,\\n_Clytemnestra_, _les Fiances d\\'Aragon_, _le Paria_, and especially\\n_Struensee_, his masterpiece, which afterwards received a new lustre in\\nbeing set to music by his brother the composer. To return to the latter,\\nwhile he was still quite a child, one of his uncles, named Meyer, who had\\nalways had a great affection for him, died, leaving him his whole fortune\\non condition that he should add to his name that of Meyer, whence resulted\\nthe name Meyerbeer, under which the composer has always been known.\\n\\nFrom his earliest years, Meyerbeer showed an exceptional bent for music.\\nHis father, far from opposing this tendency, rather encouraged him in it,\\nand gave him an excellent piano teacher, Ignace Lauska, who had been a\\npupil of Clementi. The child made such rapid progress that he was able to\\nappear at a public concert in Berlin, October 14, 1800, at which he made a\\ngreat success. He appeared again in 1803 and 1804 with the same success,\\nand it was then that the Abbe Vogler, whose disciple he became later on,\\nhearing him improvise with a rare facility, predicted that he would one\\nday be a great musician. Two or three years later, Meyerbeer had occasion\\nto play before Clementi, who was staying for some time in Berlin, on his\\nway back from Saint Petersburg, and the master was so charmed with the\\nlad\\'s talent that he consented to give him lessons during his sojourn in\\nthat city.\\n\\nAt this period, and without having given any attention to theoretic study,\\nMeyerbeer already occupied himself with composition. Guided alone by his\\ninstinct and his natural taste, he wrote numerous songs and piano pieces,\\nso that his father resolved to give him a master in composition, and fixed\\nhis choice on Bernard Anselme Weber, then leader of the orchestra at the\\nBerlin Opera. But this artist, very distinguished in his way, and who\\ncould give excellent advice on dramatic style, instrumentation, etc., was\\nnot himself sufficiently versed in the science of counterpoint and fugue\\nto be able to guide a pupil in this difficult study. Moreover, he showed\\nhimself too easily satisfied with Meyerbeer\\'s efforts. One day when the\\nlatter brought him a fugue, he could not conceal his admiration, and,\\nregarding it as a masterpiece, thought he would send it to the celebrated\\nAbbe Vogler, who had been his own teacher, hoping thereby to prove to\\nhim that he, Weber, was able to form good pupils. For several weeks they\\nanxiously awaited the Abbe\\'s response, which arrived at length in the\\nform of a bulky package. On opening it, they found that the contents\\nwere divided into three parts. The first constituted a sort of practical\\ntreatise on the fugue, written by Vogler\\'s own hand, and in which all\\nthe rules for this kind of composition were set forth in a precise and\\nsuccinct manner. The second part, which was called _The Scholar\\'s Fugue_,\\nreproduced that of Meyerbeer, analyzed step by step throughout its\\ndevelopment, with remarks which proved super-abundantly that it was far\\nfrom being good. The third part, entitled _The Master\\'s Fugue_, was that\\nwhich Vogler had constructed on Meyerbeer\\'s theme, analyzed in all its\\ndetails and in its _ensemble_, with an explanation of the reasons which\\njustified its general form and all the incidents.\\n\\nMeyerbeer was greatly impressed by the theories set forth by Vogler. He\\nimmediately put himself to work again and wrote a new fugue of eight\\nparts, according to this master\\'s principles, which he sent directly to\\nVogler at Darmstadt, his place of residence. The latter replied at once,\\nexpressing his satisfaction, and the confidence which this new work gave\\nhim in his future as an artist, and inviting him to come to Darmstadt; \"I\\nwill receive you like a son,\" said he, \"and you shall slake your thirst at\\nthe very sources of musical knowledge.\" Meyerbeer, delighted at this kind\\ninvitation, easily obtained from his father the necessary permission, and\\nwas soon on his way to Darmstadt.\\n\\nThe school of the Abbe Vogler was celebrated at that time throughout\\nGermany, and this master, who had studied in Italy with Vallotti and\\nMartini, was considered one of the first theoreticians of his time. One\\nthing is certain, and that is, that he turned out excellent pupils,\\nof whom some won great renown, and others became more or less famous.\\nAmong these were Knecht and Ritter, who themselves became remarkable\\ntheoreticians; the composers who were formed by the lessons and counsels\\nof Vogler were Winter, Gansbacher and the two immortal artists Carl Maria\\nvon Weber and Meyerbeer. It was at Vogler\\'s house that these last two met\\nfor the first time, and formed a friendship which was broken only by the\\ndeath of Weber. In after years Weber deplored the Italian tendencies of\\nMeyerbeer, who, in the first days of his career, threw his whole being\\ninto the imitation of Rossini\\'s style, but in spite of this divergence of\\nartistic views the affection which these two friends felt for one another\\nwas never altered nor disturbed for a single instant.\\n\\nIndeed, all the pupils who lived at the Abbe Vogler\\'s house entertained\\npleasant and affectionate relations toward each other, and a touching\\nrespect and profound tenderness for their excellent master. One proof of\\nthis, among many others, is the fact that after Weber\\'s death a cantata\\nwas found among his papers, bearing the following inscription: \"Cantata\\nwritten by Weber for Vogler\\'s birthday, and set to music by Meyerbeer and\\nGansbacher.\" In fact, Weber, who was a very ready verse-maker, had written\\nthe words of this cantata, while Meyerbeer had composed the music of the\\nchoruses and a trio, and Gansbacher had been charged with that of the\\n_soli_. It is probable also that the cantata was sung by the pupils of the\\nschool.\\n\\nThis house of Vogler\\'s was patriarchal; the life there was very austere,\\nvery much occupied, and the time of the pupils was exclusively devoted to\\nsevere study and practice of the art. In the morning, after the regular\\nexercises, the master gave his class an oral lesson in counterpoint.\\nThen, giving them for treatment any musical subject, sacred or profane,\\na psalm, motet, _kyrie_, ode, dramatic scene, he demanded of them a\\nsevere composition. In the evening, all being assembled in the presence\\nof the master, the compositions were performed, after which each work was\\nanalyzed theoretically, commented on, criticised, estimated, not only by\\nthe professor, but again by all the pupils, so that each of them, after\\nhaving been judged, became in his turn the judge of his own attempts and\\nthose of his rivals. It cannot be denied that this was an excellent system\\nof education, and one calculated to foster in the minds of the pupils\\nreflection and the sentiment of criticism. On a Sunday the whole household\\nwent to the cathedral, which contained two organs; Vogler played one of\\nthem, while each of his pupils, in turn, took his place at the other,\\nafter the fashion of a kind of academic tourney, in which each endeavored\\nto develop in a happy and artistic manner the subject improvised and set\\nforth by the master.\\n\\nIt was during his residence at the Abbe Vogler\\'s house that Meyerbeer\\nwrote, for the purpose of forming his hand, a great number of pieces of\\nsacred music, which he always refused to make known to the public. It was\\nat this period also that he composed an oratorio, _Gott und die Natur_,\\nwhich was his first piece publicly performed. He had been two years at\\nDarmstadt, when Vogler, wishing to give his pupils a rest, and to fortify\\ntheir minds by the contemplation of the beauties of nature, closed his\\nschool and undertook with them an excursion through Germany. It was just\\nbefore his departure on this expedition that Meyerbeer had obtained a\\nperformance of his oratorio, which resulted in the grand duke of Hesse\\nconferring on him the title of composer to the court. This oratorio was\\nbrought out at Berlin a short time after, May 8, 1811, in a concert given\\nby Weber at the Royal Theatre, where the solos were sung by Eunike, Grell\\nand Frl. Schmalz.\\n\\n[Illustration: MEYERBEER IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR.\\n\\nFrom large lithograph Memorial published at the time of his death.\\n\\nThis portion commemorates his first appearance in Berlin, where he was\\npraised for his smooth performance of Mozart\\'s Concertos.]\\n\\nThis was the starting point of Meyerbeer\\'s active career. We shall soon\\nsee him make his appearance as composer and virtuoso at the same time (for\\nMeyerbeer was an exceptional pianist), then promptly abandon his success\\nas a performer in order to give himself up without reserve to composition,\\nwith the theatre for his objective point. He was eager for glory and aimed\\nat a great reputation, feeling himself equal to any effort for reaching\\nhis end; it is this which explains the hesitations and evasions of his\\nyouth. Desirous of meeting success, withal patient, persevering and gifted\\nwith an energy which nothing could baffle, he sought it in all possible\\nways, but, whatever his critics may say, without ever sacrificing his\\nconvictions, and while always preserving for his art, as well as for the\\npublic, the most complete, the most absolute respect. His first works\\nperformed in Germany, written in a somewhat scholastic form, perhaps a\\nlittle pedantic, did not succeed according to his desire, because Germany\\nat that time, like Italy herself, was under the spell of Rossini\\'s music.\\nHe accordingly betook himself to Italy, and there wrote several operas in\\nwhich he forced himself to adopt the style and methods of that master. It\\nwas this that brought down upon him the reproaches of Weber, irritated\\nto see him, a German, deny the national genius, and submit, like so many\\nothers, to the influence of the author of the _Barber of Seville_. But\\nin spite of the criticisms of his friend, Meyerbeer, who had seen his\\nworks received with favor in Italy, continued his career in that country,\\nwhere he trained his hand and prepared the evolution which was to free\\nhis genius and direct him to France, there to write his incomparable\\nmasterpieces. For Meyerbeer, like Gluck before him, gave to France alone\\nthe full measure of his worth; like Gluck, it is to France that he owes\\nhis greatest triumphs and the best part of his glory; like Gluck, he lived\\nto see his Italian operas laid aside and well-nigh forgotten, whereas his\\nFrench operas made the tour of civilized lands, and are still played on\\nall the stages of the world.\\n\\n[Illustration: CARICATURE BUST OF MEYERBEER, BY DANTAN.\\n\\nFrom the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.]\\n\\nIt was after his trip with Vogler and his fellow-students that Meyerbeer\\ndecidedly entered his career, though not without some fumbling. In 1813\\nwe find him at Munich, where he gave an unsuccessful performance of\\n_Jephtha\\'s Daughter_, an opera in three acts, which had much the flavor\\nand style of an oratorio. Disheartened by the result, he left very soon\\nfor Vienna, resolved to make known there his exceptional talent as\\npianist. In this capacity he achieved triumph after triumph in the capital\\nof Austria; his execution was solid and brilliant, and at the same time\\nfull of poetry and charm. He played at these concerts a great number of\\nhis own compositions, which have never been published. At the same time\\nhe came twice before the Vienna public as dramatic composer, first with\\na mono-drama for soprano, clarinet obligato and chorus (the clarinetist\\nfigured as a personage of the drama) entitled _The Loves of Tevelind_,\\nthen with a comic opera in two acts, entitled _Abimelek, or The two\\nCaliphs_, performed at the court theatre. This latter, written in the\\nsomewhat heavy style of _Jephtha\\'s Daughter_, found no favor with a public\\nwhich, at that period, was under the complete influence of Italian music.\\nMeyerbeer was very much affected by this failure, and took his troubles to\\nSalieri, who was then imperial capellmeister at Vienna. Salieri, who had\\ntaken a great fancy to him, and who had confidence in his future, consoled\\nhim as best he could, lavished encouragement upon him, and counselled him\\nto make a trip into Italy. \"There,\" said he, \"you will learn to ripen your\\ntalent, to train your hand, and particularly to make a better disposition\\nof the voices in your compositions and to write for them in a more\\nrational and less fatiguing manner.\"\\n\\nAt that time Rossini was the king of musical Italy, and the enthusiasm\\nproduced by his works was beginning to take from the renown of such\\nrichly inspired artists as Cimarosa, Guglielmo, Sarti, Paisiello, his\\nimmediate predecessors. Everybody knows the influence which was exerted\\nall over musical Europe for half a century, by the exuberant and sensual,\\nthough charming and seductive, genius of the author of the _Barber_ and\\n_Cenerentola_. All the artists, not only of Italy, but of France as\\nwell and some even of Germany, came under this influence to a greater\\nor less extent. Meyerbeer escaped it no more than the rest; one might\\neven say that he had no desire to escape it. He went straight from\\nVienna to Venice, where he arrived just at the height of _Tancredi\\'s_\\nimmense success in that city; this opera, by the way, was one of the most\\npersonal, most vivacious and most savory works from Rossini\\'s pen. He\\ncould not resist the charm of this chivalresque and enchanting music, and\\nhe was so captivated by the _eclat_ of the Rossinian forms that he began\\nto assimilate them as rapidly as possible.\\n\\n[Illustration: BUST OF MEYERBEER, BY DANTAN.\\n\\nFrom the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.]\\n\\nIt is probable, however, that he reflected longer than people have\\nhitherto given him credit for, on the transformation which he allowed to\\noperate in his talent, for it was not until he had spent several years\\nin Italy, that is to say in 1818, that he appeared to the public of that\\ncountry for the first time. With his calm and meditative mind, with his\\nstudious and persevering nature, we may suppose that he employed his\\ntime in working silently, in solitude, to modify his style, to acquire\\nthe assurance which he lacked, to give elegance and facility to the\\nforms of his melody, without compromising thereby the sentiment of a\\nrich and abundant harmony, the beauties of an original and vigorous\\ninstrumentation. It was not, then, until after this complete remodelling\\nof his early education, this training of his faculties, that he decided\\nto brave the stage anew, and to solicit the approbation of a public to\\nwhom he was quite unknown. If this Italian career of Meyerbeer, of which\\nI am about to give a brief review, offers only a secondary interest from\\nthe standpoint of the value of his works, it offers a very great one as\\na transitional stage, covering as it does the period of the development\\nof his genius, and the evolution by which he was preparing himself for\\nthe great masterpieces with which he was to endow the French lyric stage,\\nthose masterpieces which were to seal his glory and render his fame\\nuniversal.\\n\\n[Illustration: CARICATURE OF MEYERBEER.\\n\\nFrom collection of prints at the Paris Opera.]\\n\\nIt was at Padua, July 10, 1818, that he gave his first Italian opera,\\n_Romilda e Costanza_, the principal role of which was written for\\nPisaroni, one of the most illustrious _cantatrices_ of that period.\\nFrom the very first performance the opera was a great success, and he\\nimmediately wrote another work, _Semiramide riconosciuta_, on an ancient\\npoem of Metastasio, which he brought out at the Royal Theatre at Turin in\\n1819. The following year he gave to the San Benedetto Theatre of Venice,\\nhis third opera, _Emma di Resburgo_, which met with enthusiastic success\\nat a moment when, on this very stage, Rossini had just triumphed with\\nhis _Edouardo e Christina_. This work fully established his reputation\\nin Italy, all the great cities esteemed it an honor to present him to\\ntheir public, and everywhere he obtained the most complete success. This\\nwas not all. The Germans themselves, who made a point of disparaging\\nItalian music, made two translations of this opera; one of them, _Emma\\nvon Leicester_, was played at Vienna, Dresden, Munich and Frankfort; the\\nother, _Emma von Roxburg_, was performed at Berlin and Stuttgart. It may\\nbe well to recall here that the subject of this work was borrowed from the\\nFrench opera _Helena_, by Mehul.\\n\\nThis colossal success opened to Meyerbeer the doors of the largest\\ntheatres of Italy. The first of them all, the Scala of Milan, immediately\\nordered a great work of him. It was _Margherita d\\'Angiu_, which was\\nperformed at this theatre Nov. 14, 1820, where it was sung by Tacchinardi,\\nLevasseur and Rosa Mariani. Here, again, the success was complete, and\\n_Margherita d\\'Angiu_, almost immediately translated and performed in\\nGermany, was afterwards translated into French for representation at the\\nOdeon. On March 12, 1822, Meyerbeer gave to the Scala theatre the opera\\n_l\\'Esule di Granata_, the first roles of which were confided to the tenor\\nWinter, to Lablache, to Mmes. Pisaroni, Adelaide Tosi and Carolina Bassi.\\nBut the last triumphs of the composer had excited envy; jealousy awoke on\\nevery side, and a cabal was organized for the purpose of crushing this new\\nwork. The first act indeed fell flat, thanks to this cabal, and the second\\nseemed doomed to the same fate, when a beautiful _duo_, admirably sung by\\nLablache and Pisaroni came just in time to save all, and change into a\\ntriumph the fall which had appeared inevitable.\\n\\nAfter this new success, Meyerbeer\\'s health failed him. He had gone to\\nRome, where he was to bring out an opera in two acts entitled _Almanzor_.\\nHe had begun to write the score, when the state of his health obliged him\\nto stop work and seek absolute rest. As soon as he was able he went to\\nGermany, where he passed the whole of the year 1823, now at Berlin, now at\\nsome watering place. In the course of this year he wrote a German opera,\\n_The Brandeburg Gate_, which was intended for the Konigstadt theatre,\\nbut which, it is not known why, was never performed. He then returned to\\nItaly, where awaited him the last and greatest triumphs in that country.\\n\\nIt is here that this second phase of Meyerbeer\\'s remarkably active and\\nproductive career will come to a close. We may be sure that he had already\\nfelt a desire to work for the French stage, whither the very nature of\\nhis powerful and profoundly dramatic genius seemed to call him. We are\\nnow to see him direct his efforts towards this end, preparing himself\\nfor the change by his last Italian work, written in a more elevated,\\nloftier strain than the preceding ones, and which seemed to indicate on\\nhis part a fixed determination to create another distinct manner. In\\norder to attain this third and last manner, ingrafted, as it were, on the\\ntwo preceding ones, it was necessary for him to adopt a method analogous\\nto the one which he had used on arriving in Italy. Just as he had to\\nabandon, on touching foot to Italian soil, everything in his style which\\nmight appear too scholastic, heavy and formal, so, in going to France,\\nhe was obliged to lay aside the affected elegance, frivolous grace and\\nsuperficial language of the Italian forms. He endeavored to retain and\\ncombine the best elements in the various schools,--to unite the melodic\\nsentiment of Italy to the harmonic richness of Germany, and to join to\\nthese the picturesque coloring, the passionate ardor, and above all the\\nsense of dramatic truth which are the characteristic qualities of the\\nFrench musical school. It was then, after he had transformed his style by\\nthis fusion of three different but not antagonistic elements, the union of\\nwhich must form a harmonious and well balanced whole, after he had become\\nmaster both of his thought and of the idea which should clothe it, it was\\nthen that he found himself in full possession of himself and of his genius\\nand that he became the great man whose name was universally known and\\nwhose works everywhere challenged admiration.\\n\\nThe great work of transition with which Meyerbeer was to crown his\\nbrilliant career in Italy and prepare his future triumphs on the French\\nstage, was called _il Crociato Egitto_. This opera, conceived in a broad\\nand severe style, plainly showed the new preoccupations of his mind and\\ngave a glimpse of his approaching evolution. The distinct individuality\\nof the composer showed itself in this remarkable score, in which it was\\neasy to see his inclination for energetic and vigorous expression of\\nthe grand dramatic situations. _Il Crociato_, brought out at the Fenice\\ntheatre, Venice, Dec. 26, 1824, had for its principal interpreters Mme.\\nMerie-Lalande, Lablache and Velluti. Its success was immense, and it soon\\nmade the tour of all Italy. This success was so great as to move Paris,\\nand the duke of Rochefoucauld, then superintendent of the royal theatres,\\nimmediately arranged to have _il Crociato_ played at the _Theatre\\nItalien_. He wrote to the composer, inviting him to come and supervise the\\nstaging of his opera and direct the rehearsals. The roles were given to\\nDanzelli, Levasseur, Mmes. Pasta, Monbelli, Schiasetti and Giovanola. This\\nwas the first of Meyerbeer\\'s works performed at Paris, and its success was\\nas great as in Italy.\\n\\n[Illustration: GIACOMO MEYERBEER.\\n\\nFrom woodcut in \"L\\'Univers Illustre,\" Paris.]\\n\\nHenceforth Meyerbeer was to belong entirely to France. After having seen\\nhis _Crociato_ played at the _Italien_, he had the satisfaction of seeing\\nhis _Margherita d\\'Angiu_ translated into French and performed successfully\\nat the _Odeon_. It was to this last fact that he owed the speedy\\ngratification of his desire to work for the musical stages of France,\\nalthough, owing to an unexpected series of events, he was obliged to await\\nfor several years the representation of his first work, and this work,\\nwritten with the _Opera Comique_ in view, had to be completely transformed\\nand adapted for the _Opera_. This is the way it happened.\\n\\nThe subject of the Italian opera of _Margherita d\\'Angiu_ had been taken\\nfrom a French drama, _Marguerite d\\'Anjou_, played in 1810 at the _Gaite_\\ntheatre, and the author of which was Guilbert de Piexercourt. The two very\\nnaturally made each other\\'s acquaintance, Piexercourt\\'s authorization\\nbeing necessary for the representation on a French stage of a foreign\\nopera whose subject belonged to him. An intimacy sprung up between them,\\nand Meyerbeer profited by it to ask Piexercourt for a poem to set to\\nmusic for the _Opera Comique_. The latter willingly consented, confided\\nto him _Robert le Diable_, by Scribe, and the composer immediately set to\\nwork. The roles of _Robert le Diable_ were to be distributed as follows:\\nPonchard (Robert), Huet (Bertram), Mme. Boulanger (Alice) and Mme. Rigaud\\n(Isabella). Obliged in the meantime to make a trip to Berlin, Meyerbeer\\ntook the poem with him, in order to continue the work during his absence.\\nBut while he was in Germany a little revolution took place at the _Opera\\nComique_ which resulted in Guilbert de Piexercourt being dispossessed\\nof his office of director. What happened then? All the particulars are\\nnot known, but _Robert_ was withdrawn from the _Opera Comique_, Scribe\\nenlarged and transformed his poem, Meyerbeer rewrote his score, and the\\nwork was carried to the _Opera_. It is easy to understand that all this\\noccasioned a long delay. But this was not all. The revolution of 1830\\noccurred, which brought everything to a standstill, and which, after the\\nchange of dynasty at the head of the country, brought about a change in\\nthe management of the _Opera_, where Lubbert was replaced by the famous\\nDr. Veron. The latter hesitated a good deal about mounting so important a\\nwork by a composer as yet little known in France, although he had achieved\\ngreat success elsewhere. He finally decided in its favor, however, the\\nroles were distributed to Nourrir, Levasseur, Mmes. Dorus-Gras and\\nCinti-Damoreau, and _Robert le Diable_ was finally performed Nov. 22, 1831.\\n\\nHowever, Meyerbeer was still to grow, and _les Huguenots_, performed at\\nthe _Opera_, Feb. 21, 1836, was to be the crowning point of his glory. It\\nshould be said that he was admirably served by his collaborator Scribe.\\nThe latter, after having given him the fantastic poem of _Robert_, wrote\\nfor him the the passionate, pathetic and dramatic poem of the _Huguenots_,\\nwhich revived at the same time a splendid page of history, in which he\\nintroduced, in the happiest manner, a picturesque element which permitted\\nthe artist to vary his palette and give to each episode a color of its\\nown. The most diverse and powerful situations abound in this superb poem,\\nand it is just to declare that Meyerbeer has interpreted them with an\\nincomparable genius.\\n\\nAfter the _Huguenots_ three years passed during which France received\\nno new work from Meyerbeer. Meanwhile people had much to say about the\\n_Prophete_; but Meyerbeer, exceptionally anxious about the good execution\\nof his works, not finding in the _personnel_ of the _Opera_ at that time\\nthe artists of whom he had dreamed for this work, waited patiently.\\nMoreover, the office of capellmeister of the king of Prussia, to which he\\nhad been appointed, called him often to Berlin during this period. It was\\nin this capacity that he composed a grand Italian cantata, _la Festa nella\\ncorte di Ferrara_, which was performed at court in 1843, and a German\\nopera in three acts, _A Camp in Silesia_, composed for the inauguration of\\nthe new royal theatre of Berlin (Dec. 7, 1844) and which was rather coldly\\nreceived. It was at this time also that he published, with French words, a\\ngreat number of admirable songs, of which a collection in four volumes has\\nrecently been formed in Paris. It was during this period that he composed\\nthe beautiful music for his brother\\'s drama, _Struensee_, and his first\\nMarch (Fackeltanz), performed for the marriage of the princess Wilhelmina\\nof Prussia with the king of Bavaria.\\n\\nFinally, on April 16, 1849, the _Prophete_, so long expected, made its\\nappearance at the Paris _Opera_, interpreted by Roger (Jean de Leyde),\\nLevasseur (Jacharie), Mme. Viardot (Fides) and Mme. Castellan (Bertha).\\n\\n_Le Pardon de Ploermel_ was the last of Meyerbeer\\'s works brought out\\nbefore his death, which occurred at Paris, May 2, 1864. For nearly twenty\\nyears _l\\'Africaine_ had been under consideration, but the master waited\\nfor this work as he had done for _le Prophete_, until the _personnel_ of\\nthe _Opera_ could offer him such artists as he deemed necessary for its\\nproper execution. Meanwhile, he had drawn up instructions relative to this\\n_Africaine_, which he wished to have carried out after his death. Among\\nother things he requested that the role of Selika be confided to Mme.\\nMarie Lasse, and that of Vasco to M. Naudin, whose voice he had admired at\\nthe _Theatre Italien_. The direction of the _Opera_ took pains to conform\\nto this posthumous desire and _l\\'Africaine_ appeared at this theatre,\\nunder the conditions specified by the composer, April 28, 1865. While\\nfully taking into account the great value of certain episodes of this\\nwork, it will surely be no violation to Meyerbeer\\'s memory to say that\\n_l\\'Africaine_ has added nothing to his glory. Even without _l\\'Africaine_\\nhe would still have remained one of the most magnificent geniuses that has\\nillumined the art of the nineteenth century.\\n\\n[Illustration: TOMB OF THE MEYERBEER FAMILY.\\n\\nFrom large lithograph Memorial published at the time of Meyerbeer\\'s death.]\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe transformation of the _genre_ of the French grand opera had begun\\nwith Auber\\'s _La Muette de Portici_, performed in 1828. _La Muette_ was\\nthe first work conceived in the new forms and in the vast proportions of\\nthe school which was to succeed the school of Gluck and his followers.\\nThe scenic development, the pursuit of new and piquant harmonies, the\\nimportance given to the orchestra; all this, joined to a more varied\\nand less uniform melodic expression, had produced a deep impression on\\nthe public, and dethroned with a single blow the ancient opera which\\nhad reigned for more than half a century. Rossini had come later with\\nhis _William Tell_, in which the splendor of the style, the richness\\nof inspiration and the fullness of dramatic expression, all carried to\\ntheir highest degree, had marked an advance over the remarkable work of\\nthe French composer, without, however, surpassing the latter\\'s elegance\\nand originality. With _Robert le Diable_, Meyerbeer, in his turn, struck\\na note entirely personal, and in this work the passionate vigor of\\naccent, the power of orchestral combinations, the particular character\\nand relief given to each of the personages, indicated a musician of a\\nnew and profoundly original genius; a genius more complex than that\\nof his predecessors, seeking for effects in the detail as well as in\\nthe _ensemble_, but arriving like them, and by different means, at an\\nintensity of expression which was difficult to surpass.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the score of _Robert le Diable_ contained\\nsuggestions of the forms adopted by the author in the course of his\\nItalian career. This is especially noticeable in the first act and the\\nbeginning of the second, and it would not have been an easy matter to\\navoid it. But the general style of the work has an incontestable grandeur,\\nthe declamation, noble and powerful, assumes the character of the French\\nlyric declamation, the contrasts of situations are striking and managed\\nwith a remarkable intelligence, and the color of the music, its fantastic\\ncharacter, so well in accord with the subject, are of such an intensity as\\nto produce on the hearer an ineffaceable impression. It is in the third\\nact especially, divided into two distinct parts, that the genius of the\\ncomposer is given full scope, and attains its most complete magnificence.\\nThe comic scene between Bertram and Raimbaut, that in which voices from\\nbelow call to Bertram, the dramatic scene between Bertram and Alice, are\\nall of a great beauty, and the tableau following, that of the evocation of\\nnuns in the depth of their cloister, with the episode of the seduction of\\nRobert, is of a wonderful poetry and grace, and contrasts in a striking\\nmanner with that which precedes. In the fourth act it is the human passion\\nwhich speaks its most pathetic language from the grand duet of Robert\\nand Isabelle to the moment when the powerful finale comes to prove to us\\nthat Gluck\\'s genius and his transports are not unknown to the genius of\\nMeyerbeer. As to the fifth act, it is of an admirable dramatic feeling.\\n\\nThe novelty of the forms and the hitherto unusual development of the\\nscore of _Robert_ at first surprised the public, which was cautious about\\npassing judgment. But surprise soon gave way to admiration, admiration\\ngrew to enthusiasm, and triumph, a triumph perhaps without precedent on\\nthe French stage, welcomed a work so abounding in beauties of a very high\\norder. It is well known how rapidly the whole world ratified the judgment\\nof the Parisian public.\\n\\nMeyerbeer has been criticised for his Italian souvenirs in his opera _les\\nHuguenots_, particularly that pretty air of Marguerite\\'s in the second\\nact, charming in itself and from a strict musical point of view, but\\nwhich is evidently an aside, a concession made to virtuosity, and which\\nbreaks the _ensemble_ and the unity of an otherwise strong, noble and\\nsevere work. This fault aside, however, what a masterpiece is this score\\nof the _Huguenots_, in which the interest steadily increases, and which,\\nfrom the first scene to the last, never ceases to rise higher and higher!\\nAdmiration knows not how to choose nor where to pause, so constant and\\nvaried are the demands made upon it, whether by the marvellous tableaux,\\nlike that of the arrival of Raoul at Marguerite\\'s house, the picturesque\\ncurfew scene in the third act, the duel scene which follows, the powerful\\nepisode of the benediction of the poignards in the fourth, followed\\nby the splendid duet of Raoul and Valentine, finally the scene of the\\nmassacre of the Huguenots in the fifth,--or by the delineation of the\\ncharacters, traced with a surprising vigor and sureness of hand, such as\\nthose of Marcel, of Saint-Bris and of Nevers, which make an ineffaceable\\nimpression on the memory. And what color, what style, what grandeur from\\nthe beginning to the end of this work! Whether it be the dramatic element\\nwhich dominates, as in the duel scene or that of the conjuration, whether\\nit be the pathetic and passionate element, as in the _duo_ of the lovers,\\nwhether it be the popular and picturesque element, as in the entire third\\nact, the superiority of the artist is always the same, always equally\\ncomplete, with no sign of weakness nor faltering. In this opera he recalls\\nwith vividness and truth a world which has disappeared, and his music is\\nmarvellously in accord with the period which he undertakes to depict,\\nthe personages which he presents to us, and even the costumes of those\\npersonages. As to the inspiration, always warm, noble and vigorous, it is\\nof an inexpressible richness and power.\\n\\n[Illustration: [Music]\\n\\nFac-simile of Meyerbeer\\'s musical manuscript, written in 1852.]\\n\\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of Meyerbeer\\'s letter to his brother, written in\\n1837.]\\n\\nThe austere subject of the opera of _le Prophete_, in which the element\\nof passion played only a very secondary role, caused it to be received at\\nfirst with a certain reserve on the part of the public. But Meyerbeer\\nhad never been better inspired, and the nobleness, the grandeur and the\\nseverity of the style of this composition raises it to a level which he\\ndid not exceed. The beautiful introduction to the first act, the scene\\nof the three anabaptists, the marvellous ballet of skaters, the arioso\\nof Fides in prison, a truly sublime and pathetic page, finally the\\ngrand tableau of the cathedral, are so many superb and living proofs of\\nMeyerbeer\\'s powerful and versatile genius. The public grew to admire the\\nbeauties of this bold and dignified work; as to the artists, there are\\nmany who unhesitatingly place the _Prophete_ above all that he has written\\nfor the stage; for myself, I divide my highest admiration between _le\\nProphete_ and _les Huguenots_.\\n\\n[Illustration: REPRODUCTION OF ORIGINAL BILLBOARD OF FIRST PERFORMANCE OF\\nTHE HUGUENOTS.\\n\\nFrom archives of the Paris Opera.]\\n\\nThe success of _l\\'Etoile du Nord_, performed at the _Opera-Comique_, Feb.\\n16, 1854, was much more spontaneous and considerable than that of the\\n_Prophete_ at the _Opera_. Yet, after the lapse of forty years, the latter\\nis still played on all the stages of the world, whereas _l\\'Etoile du Nord_\\nis well-nigh forgotten. Assuredly there are some beautiful pages in this\\nscore, in which Meyerbeer embodied several pieces from his German opera,\\n_A Camp in Silesia_, and especially should be mentioned the songs and\\nthe ballad of Catherine in the first act, the quintet in the second, the\\nsuperb song of Pierre in the third, as well as the comic duet and trio;\\nbut the work is essentially lacking in unity, it is too heavy as a whole,\\nand the orchestration is too noisy and brilliant for the demi-character of\\nthe opera. Meyerbeer was much better inspired in _le Pardon de Ploermel_\\n(Dinorah), given also at the _Opera-Comique_, April 4, 1839. This work\\ncontains some exquisite pages, among which I will mention particularly the\\noverture with invisible chorus, Hoel\\'s air in the first act, the drinking\\nchorus and the trio in the second, and the touching and melancholy song of\\nHoel in the third. Unfortunately the insignificance and emptiness of the\\nlibretto have always been a drawback to this beautiful score.\\n\\nWhat are the salient traits of Meyerbeer\\'s genius, and what influence has\\nthis genius exerted upon his contemporaries? Such is the double question\\nwhich presents itself to us in the presence of the works of this great\\nman. First of all should be remarked his power of inspiration and power\\nof conception. He was the first to give to France the example of these\\nfive-act operas of colossal dimensions, the performance of which requires\\nfully five hours, and the richness, the power of his inspiration is such\\nthat so far from weakening during the course of these five long acts, it\\nis often higher, more sublime at the end than at the beginning. Witness\\nthe fifth acts of all his great works; _Robert_, _les Huguenots_, _le\\nProphete_, _l\\'Africaine_; every one of them is a masterpiece! As to the\\npower of conception, that mysterious faculty of unifying the different\\nparts of a work so large and complex as each of his operas, and forming of\\nthem a harmonic, homogeneous whole, it is trully marvellous, and indicates\\na peculiarly organized and quite exceptional musical brain. Everything,\\nindeed, is to be found in his works; dramatic sentiment is carried to its\\nhighest power, the musical style is full of splendor, the general form is\\nsuperb, the harmony is solid and substantial, and the union of the voices\\nwith the instruments admits of no criticism. If there were any fault\\nto be found with him it would be in the excess of sonority, sometimes\\noverwhelming, which he gives to the orchestra. But on the other hand, how\\nmuch he has improved the orchestra, giving it increased interest and life,\\nas well as variety of color, of timbre and of effect! What an important\\npart it takes in certain situations, and how carefully, conscientiously\\nand cleverly it is managed!\\n\\nConscience, indeed, was one of Meyerbeer\\'s master qualities. Others, so\\nrichly gifted, might perhaps have been content to follow the course of\\ntheir inspiration, without taking the trouble to enrich it, to fortify\\nit with the aid of all the means which art puts at the disposal of the\\ncomposer. He neglected nothing, no detail, no effect, no method that\\nenabled him to augment his resources, to complete his thought, in a\\nword, to attain perfection, or what he believed to be perfection. Nothing\\ndismayed him, he spared no pains to realize his ideal, to obtain the\\nresult at which he aimed, and he never felt that he had done a thing so\\nwell that it could not be improved. Thus his works have the solidity of\\nmarble and the strength of iron. And if a blemish be sometimes discovered\\nin them, it is like the spots on the sun, which do not interfere with its\\ndazzling light.\\n\\nIn regard to the influence exerted by Meyerbeer upon his contemporaries,\\nalthough genuine and unmistakable, it cannot be said to be so complete or\\nso general as that exerted by Rossini. And this is due to the nature of\\nhis genius, which was very complex, and in which cerebral reflection and\\nthe combination of means held as important a place as inspiration properly\\nspeaking. It was easy to imitate, without obtaining the same results,\\nthe methods and the forms employed by Rossini (I refer to the _Italian_\\nRossini, and not the Rossini of _William Tell_); very much less easy was\\nit to imitate the forms and the methods of Meyerbeer, these being not only\\nmore complicated, more varied, but essentially dependent on the subject,\\non the situations, on the episodes. This is why Meyerbeer\\'s influence has\\nbeen mainly felt in the conception and general form of a work, and has\\nbeen much less sensible in technical detail and musical method.\\n\\nIn closing, I would say that Meyerbeer is one of the noblest, most\\nglorious artists who have ever shed lustre not only upon the French stage,\\nbut on musical art as applied to the theatre. A great musician, but\\nespecially a great dramatic musician, he has power, nobility, bold and\\nheroic inspiration, and above all the gift of emotion, of that poignant\\nand vigorous emotion which stirs the spectator, wrings his heart, lays\\nhold upon his very vitals, and forces the tears from his eyes.\\n\\n[Illustration: Arthur Pougin]\\n\\n[Illustration: FRESCO IN THE VIENNA OPERA HOUSE,\\n\\nIllustrating Meyerbeer\\'s Opera \"The Huguenots.\"]\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHANN STRAUSS\\n\\n_Reproduction of a photograph from life of the younger Johann Strauss._\\n\\n_Published by Reichard & Lindner, Berlin, 1887._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSTRAUSS\\n\\n\\nThe name of Strauss bids fair to become as numerously represented in the\\nannals of Nineteenth Century music as was that of Bach in the seventeenth\\nand eighteenth centuries; with this difference, however, that while the\\nBachs were all of one family, three of the Strausses who have become\\nsufficiently famous to win a place in the musical dictionaries are not\\nrelated to the other three or four. It is with those that _are_ related,\\nthe family of Johann Strauss, the Viennese \"Waltz-King,\" that this article\\nis concerned.\\n\\nA few years ago (1887) the famous Leipsic publishing house of Breitkopf\\nand Hartel commenced the issue of a complete collection of the waltzes,\\npolkas, and other dance pieces of the elder Johann Strauss. The first\\nvolume has an interesting though brief biographic sketch by Johann\\nStrauss, Jr., who relates some of his personal reminiscences of his\\nfather, besides other facts previously known to the public. \"My father,\"\\nhe says in the opening paragraph, \"was a musician by the grace of God. Had\\nhe not been guided by an inner, irresistible impulse, the difficulties\\nwhich confronted him in his youth would have pushed him into another path.\"\\n\\nIt is interesting to note how this \"impulse\" would have its own way, as in\\nthe case of other famous musicians, notwithstanding parental opposition.\\nStrauss was born at Vienna on March 14, 1804. When he was a mere child\\nhe used to amuse himself (as Haydn had done in his childhood) by taking\\ntwo sticks and imitating the movements of a fiddler. Great was his joy\\nwhen his father, having discovered this instinctive trait, made him a\\npresent of a small violin and allowed him to take lessons on it in the\\nprimary school. But this was as far as parental encouragement went. Little\\nJohann\\'s desire to become a professional musician was not countenanced,\\nand at the age of fourteen he was sent to a book-binder to learn his\\ntrade; but he soon tired of this work and when his master added insult\\nto injury by forbidding him to play the violin, he packed up his beloved\\ninstrument and his few other possessions and ran away. In a suburb of\\nVienna he came across a friend who induced him to return to his parents,\\nwhom he persuaded at the same time to give up opposing his musical\\ninclinations. So he received regular lessons and was soon able to play in\\na small local orchestra.\\n\\nAs luck would have it, another musician, who was destined to be Strauss\\'s\\ncolleague and rival, Joseph Lanner, was at that time beginning his\\nbrilliant career in Vienna. He was four years older than Strauss, and had\\nassociated himself with two other musicians for the purpose of playing in\\nthe cafes which abounded in that city. Strauss begged permission to join\\nthis club, and was accepted as viola player, one of his duties being the\\npassing around of the plate for collections. There was so much animation\\nand true musical feeling in the performances of this club that it became\\nimmensely popular and soon Lanner found it impossible to accept all the\\nengagements that were offered. This led him to engage more musicians and\\nultimately to divide his orchestra into two smaller ones, over one of\\nwhich he himself presided, while Strauss was placed at the head of the\\nother.\\n\\nBut Strauss was an ambitious man, and after this companionship had lasted\\nsix years (1819-1825) he made his \"declaration of independence\" of Lanner\\nand conducted an orchestra of his own, which soon became \"all the rage\"\\nin Vienna. His son has sketched this important episode so eloquently that\\nI cannot do better than translate his words: \"The public now learned\\nto know him as an independent conductor, and as such he soon became so\\npopular that the dance-loving Viennese were divided into two parties--the\\n_Lannerianer_ and the _Straussianer_--each of which championed its\\nidol with ardor. It redounds to the credit of the good old times that\\nthis partisanship could not cloud the personal relations between Lanner\\nand Strauss, who continued to remain good friends. Their professional\\nseparation at this time was brought about by another circumstance: my\\nfather accidentally discovered his talent for composition. Composing was\\nobviously at that time an easier matter than it is to-day. To produce a\\npolka, contemporary musicians study the whole literature of music and\\nperhaps a few philosophical systems too. Formerly, only one thing was\\nneeded to compose: One had to have a happy thought, as the popular saying\\nis (_es musste Einem was einfallen_). And strange to say, these happy\\nthoughts always came. Self-confidence in this respect was so great that we\\nof the old school (_wir Alten_) frequently announced for a certain evening\\na new waltz of which on the morning of the same day not a single note\\nwas written. In such a case the orchestra usually went to the composer\\'s\\nhouse, and as soon as the latter had finished a part it was immediately\\ncopied for the orchestra. Meantime, the miracle of the \\'happy thought\\'\\nrepeated itself for the other parts of the waltz; in a few hours the piece\\nwas completed, whereupon it was rehearsed, and in the evening it was\\nplayed before a usually enthusiastic public.\\n\\n\"Lanner--light-hearted and careless--hardly ever composed any other way.\\nOne morning it happened that he felt ill and unable to work, while a new\\nset of waltzes had been promised for the evening, and of course not a\\nbar was on paper. He sent my father the simple message: \\'Strauss, see if\\nyou can think of something\\' (in the quaint Viennese dialect: _Strauss,\\nschauen\\'s dass Ihnen was einfallt_.)--In the evening the new waltz was\\nplayed--as Lanner\\'s, of course--and was received with extraordinary favor.\\nThis circumstance, combined with his marriage in the same year, induced my\\nfather to secure his independence. He organized at first a quintet, but\\nafter barely a year his orchestra already numbered fourteen men. At what\\nrate his fame and his popularity both as composer and conductor grew, is\\na thing of which we, in these prosaic days, can hardly have a conception.\\nThe years 1830 to 1836, during which my father presided over the music at\\nthe Sperl, will always remain memorable in the history of music at Vienna.\\nThe audiences were enormous, the enthusiasm unbounded, and as my father\\nwas persuaded to accept engagements for other amusement places too, he\\nhad at his disposal, during the carnival, about two hundred musicians.\\nFrom this he selected a corps of _elites_--his _Stammorchester_--which he\\nsucceeded by unceasing rehearsals in bringing to a point of perfection\\nsuch as no other private orchestra had ever reached. Visitors to Vienna\\ncarried the fame of these musicians to other parts of the world, and\\ninvitations soon came to him to play in other cities.\"\\n\\nThe rest of Johann Strauss\\'s life is simply a record of his triumphs in\\nthe cities of Germany, Holland, France, Belgium and England, as well as in\\nVienna, where he was appointed director of the Court balls in 1835. From\\n1833 to 1849, the year of his death, he made a tour almost every year,\\nand he was the first musician, so far as the records show, who undertook\\nto travel with a whole orchestra. In 1837-38 his tour extended as far as\\nParis and London. In evidence of his great success in Paris it is related\\nthat when he gave a series of thirty concerts in conjunction with the\\npopular Musard, whose orchestra played after Strauss\\'s, one half of the\\naudience usually left the hall after Strauss had finished his part of the\\nprogram. In London he arrived most opportunely about the time of Queen\\nVictoria\\'s coronation, when merry music was in great demand, and here he\\ngave no fewer than seventy-two concerts, besides playing at many balls.\\nLondon, however, did not agree with his health. At his first visit he fell\\nill there, and his second visit, in 1849, proved fatal, for he brought\\nwith him the germs of disease (scarlet fever) to which he succumbed\\nshortly after his return to Vienna. He died on Sept. 25, aged 45. All the\\nViennese joined in doing him homage, and a vast concourse--his son says\\none hundred thousand--accompanied his coffin to the grave.\\n\\nRegarding his personal appearance, Herr C. F. Pohl, the Viennese librarian\\nsays, that \"though small he was well made and distinguished looking, with\\na singularly formed head. His dress was always neat and well chosen.\\nThough lively in company, he was naturally rather silent. From the moment\\nhe took his violin in his hand he became another man, whose whole being\\nseemed to expand with the sounds he drew from it.\" In his own home the\\n\"Waltz-King,\" who contributed so much to ball-room merriment, appears to\\nhave been unhappy. His father had been the keeper of a beer house, and\\nhe himself married the daughter of an innkeeper, Anna Streim, from whom he\\nwas divorced on the ground of incompatibility of temper, after eighteen\\nyears. They had five children--two daughters and three sons, Johann,\\nJoseph and Eduard, all three of whom have became famous in the annals of\\ndance music.\\n\\n[Illustration: FROM A PORTRAIT OF THE ELDER JOHANN STRAUSS IN EARLY\\nMANHOOD.\\n\\nDrawn and lithographed by C. Lutherer.]\\n\\nEduard, the youngest, born on Feb. 14, 1835, has proved the least talented\\nof the three. His compositions, numbering over two hundred, though often\\npiquant in harmony and cleverly orchestrated, are deficient in melodic\\nspontaneity and originality and often a mere echo of his brother Johann\\'s\\ngenius. (There are melodious exceptions, the Doctrinen Walzer, opus 79,\\ne. g.) He is a good conductor of dance music, and since the death of his\\nbrother Josef, in 1870, and the retirement of Johann from executive music\\nin the same year, he has been sole conductor of the Strauss orchestra at\\ncourt balls and in the Volksgarten.\\n\\nJosef, the second of the brothers, had more talent for composition than\\nEduard. He was of delicate constitution and lived only forty-three years\\n(Aug. 22, 1827, to July 22, 1870), yet the number of his original pieces\\nis two hundred and eighty-three, to which must be added about three\\nhundred arrangements. Some of his waltzes and polkas--like the \"Village\\nSwallows\" and \"Woman\\'s Heart\"--have become great favorites, and deservedly\\nso, but I cannot agree with the opinion, which has been held, that he was\\nthe superior--or even the equal--of his brother Johann. He was a good\\npianist, and for a number of years divided with his brothers the task of\\nconducting the Strauss orchestra in Vienna.\\n\\nWe now come to Johann Strauss, the oldest of the brothers, born Oct. 25,\\n1825, and still living. It is not often that a man of genius has a son\\nwho attains even greater eminence than himself, but in this case the palm\\nmust be awarded to Johann Strauss, Jr., whose creative power was not only\\ngreater than that of his brothers, but soared into regions of which even\\nhis father never dreamed.\\n\\nHis talent for music was manifested at a very early age, but his father\\ndid not encourage it--forgetting how much he himself had suffered in his\\nchildhood from parental opposition to his natural inclinations. It was\\nHorace who remarked, almost two thousand years ago, that no man is quite\\nsatisfied with his occupation, and everyone fancies he would have been\\nhappier had he chosen some other career. This may have been the reason why\\nthe elder Strauss, in the midst of his honors and remarkable popularity,\\ndecided that none of his sons should become musicians. Johann was to be\\na merchant, Josef an engineer, and for Eduard, too, some non-musical\\nemployment would have been selected had not his father died before he was\\nfourteen.\\n\\nFortunately for Johann, his mother secretly encouraged his fondness for\\nmusic, allowing him to take lessons on the violin and in composition. His\\nfirst waltz was written when he was only six years old, and called his\\n\\'First Thought.\\' That was sixty years ago, and every one of these years\\nhas added several waltzes to his list. As a conductor he made his first\\nventure at the age of nineteen, with a band of his own; and when his\\nfather died, five years later, he took his place and remained at the head\\nof his orchestra for ten years. As an \"orchestral traveller\" he was even\\nmore enterprising than his father had been, for he extended his journeys\\nas far as America and St. Petersburg, being heard at Gilmore\\'s Jubilee at\\nBoston in 1869, while in St. Petersburg he gave a series of concerts every\\nsummer, from 1856 to 1866, always returning to Vienna in winter to furnish\\nthe music for the court festivities and the numerous other balls given in\\nthat gay city during the carnival.\\n\\nThe eminent Viennese critic, Dr. Hanslick, a personal friend of Strauss,\\nsays of this early period of his career: \"The incessant dispenser of joys\\nto all Vienna, Father Strauss, was a tyrant at home. The sons grew up\\namid the embittering and demoralizing impressions of an unhappy family\\nlife. Finally Johann emancipated himself, trusting in his talent, of\\nwhich he felt certain, and on that Dommayer-evening suddenly came forth\\nas a musical rival of his father. The first three works, with which he\\nmade his debut, were the waltzes, \\'Gunstwerber,\\' \\'Sinngedichte\\' and the\\n\\'Herzenslust\\' Polka.... The young man\\'s animal spirits, so long repressed,\\nnow began to foam over; favored by his talent, intoxicated by his early\\nsuccesses, petted by the women, Johann Strauss passed his youth in wild\\nenjoyment, always productive, always fresh and enterprising, at the same\\ntime frivolous to the point of adventurousness. As in appearance he\\nresembles his father, handsomer, however, more refined and modern, so also\\nhis waltzes had the unmistakable Strauss family physiognomy, not without\\na tendency to originality. Our Viennese, the most expert judges in such\\nmatters, at once recognized the budding talent of the young Strauss, who\\npromised soon to overtake his famous parent.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: JOSEPH STRAUSS.\\n\\nFrom a lithograph by Maurin, at the Paris Opera Library.]\\n\\nFor more than a quarter of a century Strauss continued to devote himself\\nto the creation and the conducting of dance music; and the number of his\\npieces in this _genre_ rose to over three hundred. His opus 314 was the\\n\"Blue Danube Waltz,\" which has since become famous not only as a sort of\\nsecond Austrian national hymn, by the side of Haydn\\'s \"Gott erhalte Franz\\nden Kaiser,\" but as the transition to a new sphere of activity. For it was\\n_a vocal waltz_, being written for male chorus and orchestra; and just as\\nBeethoven\\'s choral symphony, according to Wagner, pointed to the necessity\\nof the music-drama, so it seems that Strauss used this vocal waltz as a\\ntransition to the Viennese operetta, a new style of stage-music which owes\\nits present form and vogue chiefly to his genius.\\n\\nIt is said that Strauss\\'s wife was largely instrumental in making him\\nchange his sphere from the humble dance hall to the more ambitious\\ntheatre. She was a famous singer and actress, named Jetty Treffz, when\\nStrauss married her in 1863, and if she was really responsible for her\\nhusband\\'s \"new departure,\" the world owes her a large debt of gratitude.\\nShe died in April, 1879, and toward the close of the same year Strauss\\nmarried the dramatic singer, Angelica Dittrich.\\n\\nTwo years after his first marriage he sent Eduard in his place to St.\\nPetersburg, and in 1870 he also resigned his position as conductor of the\\ncourt balls in his brother\\'s favor. But if any one fancied that he had\\nlost his interest in music, or, like Rossini, intended to retire from\\nactive life when his triumph was at its height, the error was soon made\\nmanifest; for in 1871 Johann Strauss appeared on the boards of the Theater\\nan der Wien with something which no one had ever expected of him--an\\noperetta. \"Indigo\" was its name, and its reception was sufficiently\\ngratifying to encourage him to try another and still another, with\\never-increasing success.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHANN STRAUSS (Senior).\\n\\nCaricature by Dantan in the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.]\\n\\nSome of these operettas--especially _The Bat_ (_Fledermaus_), the _Merry\\nWar_, the _Queen\\'s Lace Handkerchief_, and the _Gypsy Baron_--became\\nenormously popular in Austria, Germany and the United States (where they\\nhave been sung successfully in both German and English), and if anything\\nhad been needed to make the \"Waltz King\" known to the whole world, and\\nadmired by everybody, these operettas would have brought about that result.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt is a strange but suggestive fact that although no name is better\\nknown in the musical world than that of the Strauss family, most of the\\nhistories of music ignore it almost entirely. And why should the erudite\\nhistorians honor with their attention a mere Strauss, who was _only a man\\nof genius_ and never constructed any symphonies, oratorios, or operas?\\nScores of composers are treated of in these histories whose genius was not\\na tithe of that of Johann Strauss, father or son; but because they wrote\\na number of (tedious and now forgotten) sonatas and symphonies, they are\\nconsidered worthy of attention by these writers! Even Chopin has often\\nbeen treated by historians in a similar gingerly manner, because he wrote\\nhardly anything but short pieces for the pianoforte; as if there were not\\nmore genius and beauty and suggestiveness in most of Chopin\\'s five-minute\\npieces than in many one-hour symphonies and four-hour operas. The same may\\nbe said of not a few Strauss waltzes.\\n\\n[Illustration: Polka\\n\\nJohann Strauss, (Junior.)]\\n\\nWherein lies this originality that entitles the name of Strauss to\\nso prominent a place in musical history? It lies partly in the\\nindividuality of their style and ideas; but still more in their having\\nsucceeded in making the waltz the most popular form of modern dance-music\\nthroughout the civilized world, and in the creation of a new style of\\noperetta, or comic opera. In the first of these achievements all the\\nmembers of the Strauss family have cooperated, while in the last the\\ncredit belongs to the second Johann alone.\\n\\n[Illustration: Simple--Valse\\n\\nStrauss (Johann Strauss--Senior.)]\\n\\nTo inoculate the world with a passion for a special form of dance music is\\nnot such an easy thing as it seems at first sight. National customs and\\ninclinations stand in the way. As Rubinstein has remarked, \"A melody which\\nmoves a Finn to tears will leave a Spaniard cold, a dance rhythm which\\nmakes a Hungarian skip will not disturb an Italian in his rest, etc.\" To\\nhave made all the young people in the world dance to the rhythm of the\\nAustrian waltz is, therefore, a feat which required the magic power of\\ngenius for its performance. And not only has the waltz been universally\\nadopted, but it has become the dance of dances, the modern dance _par\\nexcellence_, the rapturous dance in which the _young people_ find an\\nembodiment of the glowing passion of love, while in the old-fashioned\\ndances,--the minuet at their head--it was the _old people_ and the\\nchaperons who did the stiff and formal dancing in a slow and stately\\nmovement.\\n\\nOf course the honor of making the waltz cosmopolitan does not belong to\\nthe Strausses alone. The Austrian Lanner, the Bohemian Labitzky, the\\nHungarian Gungl and others had their share, but they can be regarded\\nmerely as satellites, who could only revolve around the world by revolving\\naround Strauss. Nor did Strauss invent the waltz. It \"just growed,\" like\\nTopsy, among the people, and the time and even the country of its origin\\nare under dispute. It was at Vienna however, about a century ago, that\\nit first came into notice; and as it was developed chiefly by Viennese\\ncomposers, and is danced most generally by the people of that part of\\nEurope, the popular notion that Vienna is the home of the waltz does not\\ncall for correction. A few waltz-like pieces had been written by Mozart\\nand Beethoven, but they are, as Dr. Hanslick remarks, \"astonishingly dry\\nand insignificant,\" and it remained for that genuine Viennese genius\\nFranz Schubert, to first infuse true musical genius into this form of\\ncomposition. Schubert is the real originator of the modern waltz, as of\\nthe Lied for the voice, and the song for the piano. In the Peters edition\\nthere is, besides a volume of Schubert\\'s Marches and one of Polonaises,\\none of his \"Dances\" (seventy-four pages), mostly waltzes, \"valses nobles,\"\\n\"valses sentimentales.\" No. 13 of the last name is that most exquisite\\npiece which Liszt has made such fine use of in his \"Soirees de Vienne,\"\\nand which may be regarded as the predecessor, and the equal, of the noble\\nwaltzes of Chopin, Rubinstein, Brahms and other modern composers. Indeed,\\nthese Schubert waltzes contain the germs of most of the later developments\\nof the waltz for the piano.\\n\\nIn thus giving Schubert his due we do not detract from the merit of the\\nelder Strauss. He was of course far from having the genius of Schubert,\\nbut he did a great work in transferring the Schubert spirit to the\\norchestral and dance-waltz. For the first time people came to cafes and\\ndance halls to listen to music for its own sake instead of regarding it\\nmerely as an aid to conversation and dancing. Strauss not only had the\\ngift of inventing original themes, he also had the skill to clothe them\\nin a charming orchestral garb. Great composers, like Cherubini, Meyerbeer\\nand Mendelssohn, recognized his talent, and Wagner wrote in 1863 that\\n\"a single Strauss waltz surpasses in grace, refinement and real musical\\nsubstance, the majority of the oft-laboriously-collected foreign products.\"\\n\\nTo quote Johann the younger once more on his father: \"He has borne the\\nfame of German dance-music over the whole world, and severe judges have\\nnot hesitated to acknowledge that his gay and piquant rhythms bubbled from\\nthe pure fount of musical art. As a conductor he had that indefinable\\nquality which carried away the performers, was communicated by them to the\\nhearers, and made their hearts and pulses beat faster.\" He was the first\\nto introduce the custom of giving a name to his dance music, and each of\\nhis pieces--including one hundred and fifty waltzes, fourteen polkas,\\ntwenty-eight galops, nineteen marches, and thirty-five quadrilles, has\\nits own title, either characteristically Viennese, or referring to his\\ntravels or the emotions which a dance piece is apt to evoke, or purely\\nfanciful. The quadrille was imported by Strauss from Paris. His marches\\nare the least interesting of his compositions, and his waltzes the most\\nfascinating and meritorious, the polkas ranking next.\\n\\nIn his early waltzes the elder Strauss often begins, like Schubert,\\nwithout an introduction and ends with a very short coda. Gradually,\\nhowever (though with exceptions), the introduction and coda assume greater\\ndimensions; but it remained for Johann the son to show how greatly the\\nmusical and emotional value of the waltz can be increased by elaborating\\nthe slow amorous introduction as well as the coda, in which all the themes\\nof the preceding numbers can once more be brought forward and ingeniously\\ndeveloped or combined. Schubert\\'s last set of waltzes consists of a chain\\nof twenty links or parts. The elder Strauss has usually only five or six\\nlinks in his chain; and his son shows a tendency to decrease that number\\nto three or four separate parts, while giving the introduction the aspect\\nof a short overture, with several changes of tempo, often delightfully\\nfore-shadowing the waltz themes in a dreamy, passionate and tender manner,\\nas if interpreting the thoughts of the young lovers who perchance are\\nlooking forward to their first embrace in the disguise of a waltz. In\\nthe \"Stories from the Vienna Forest\" Waltzes, opus 325, the introduction\\ncovers more than two pages of the piano score--one hundred and twenty\\nbars, with four changes of tempo. The first number consists of forty-four\\nbars, whereas originally each number consisted of eight or sixteen bars\\nonly; and the coda of one hundred and fifty-seven bars. And that this\\nwaltz, like all his best ones, is intended quite as much for the concert\\nhall as for the ball room is indicated by the signs for retarding or\\naccelerating and by the insertion of eighteen bars which are marked \"to be\\nomitted in playing for a dance.\" I have noticed, however, that at Viennese\\ndances, when conductors, players, and dancers are simultaneously entranced\\nby the intoxicating Strauss music, there is a slight tendency on the part\\nof the couples to yield to the _rubato_ or capricious coquetry of movement\\nwhich is natural to this music. Such _rubato_ dancing raises that art\\nitself to a poetic height; but it is perhaps vain to hope for it outside\\nof a Viennese dance hall.\\n\\nAs the younger Johann\\'s waltzes ceased to be a mere accompaniment to\\ndancing and assumed the function of interpreting the thoughts and feelings\\nof lovers as they are whirled along, \"imparadised in one another\\'s arms,\"\\nhis harmonies became more and more piquant and novel, his instrumentation\\nmore tender, refined, dreamy and voluptuous. Berlioz, himself, in\\norchestrating Weber\\'s superb \"Invitation to the Dance,\" has not shown\\ngreater genius for instrumentation than Strauss the son has in his later\\nwaltzes. It might be said that whereas Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven\\nbuilt up the symphony from dance forms, Strauss, conversely, applied the\\nsymphonic resources of the orchestra to his dance pieces. One can get no\\nidea of their real charm at the piano; but Americans have been fortunate\\nin having had in Mr. Theodore Thomas for many years such a sympathetic and\\nanimated interpreter, who knew how to give them the true Strauss swing.\\nNot all of these waltzes are of equal value, and popularity is no test\\nof merit. Thus, the \"Blue Danube\" Waltz, of which over a million copies\\nhave been sold, is really one of the poorest, just as Schubert\\'s Serenade\\nis far from being his best song and the Wedding March from being the gem\\nof \"Lohengrin.\" Their number is enormous--440 is the opus number of the\\n\"Gross-Wien\" Walzer, the last one printed up to the end of 1891.\\n\\nWhen Strauss turned to composing operettas, there was great consternation,\\nbecause it was feared that the Carnival in Vienna and elsewhere would have\\nto dispense thereafter with its annual gifts from his pen. These fears\\nwere unfounded; his operettas were so full of waltz and polka buds and\\nfull-blown roses, that it was easy to pick them for a concert-hall and\\nball-room bouquet; so that some of his best recent dance pieces are taken\\nfrom his operettas. Equally unfounded were the fears that after devoting\\nmore than a quarter of a century to the composition of dance music,\\nStrauss would be unable to win distinction as a dramatic writer. In his\\nfirst operettas, it is true, the libretto was little more than a peg to\\nhang on waltzes, polkas and marches; but gradually he emancipated himself\\nmore and more from the simple saltatorial style, until, in \"The Bat,\"\\nthe \"Merry War\" and subsequent works, he created a new type of operetta,\\nwith beautiful flowing, lyric melodies, and stirring dramatic ensembles.\\nTrue, the \"Waltz King\" is never quite able to disguise his character, but\\nin this very fact lie the originality and unique charm of the Strauss\\noperetta. It is a new style of stage play--the Austrian operetta, a new\\n\"school\" of comic opera; and in creating this, Strauss placed himself far\\nabove his father and his brothers. Millœcker would not have been possible\\nbut for Strauss, and Suppe did not write his best works till after Strauss\\nhad shown the way.\\n\\nThat J. Strauss, the younger, wrote four hundred and forty pieces of dance\\nmusic has already been stated. The complete list of his operettas is as\\nfollows: _Indigo_, 1871; _The Carnival in Rome_, 1873; _The Bat_, 1874;\\n_Cagliostro_, 1875; _Prince Methusalem_, 1877; _Blind Man\\'s Buff_, 1878;\\n_The Queen\\'s Lace Handkerchief_, 1880; _The Merry War_, 1881; _A Night in\\nVenice_, 1883; _The Gypsy Baron_, 1885; _Simplicius_, 1887. In my opinion\\nthere is in these operettas more good music than in the operettas of any\\nother composer, but Strauss has been less fortunate in his librettists\\nthan Offenbach and Sullivan, and this has not only diminished the\\npresent popularity of his works in some countries, but will prevent them\\nfrom enjoying as long a life as their truly prodigal wealth of new and\\ncharming melodies would otherwise entitle them to. Moreover, few things\\nare so short-lived as operettas, and it is therefore probable that, to\\nthe next generation, Strauss will be chiefly known as the \"Waltz King,\"\\nafter all, partly by the pieces which he wrote directly for the dance\\nhall, and partly by those which are culled from his dramatic works. He is\\nstill at work, with greater ambition than ever, for his latest opus is\\na grand opera, _Ritter Pasman_, which had its first performance at the\\nImperial Opera at Vienna on January 1, 1892. It is modelled partly on\\nWagner\\'s _Meistersinger_, and the _Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik_ finds in it\\nthe true type of the comic opera of the future, \"combining the _esprit_\\nand grace of French opera comique with German depth of sentiment, and\\nthat spontaneous melodiousness which is an Austrian specialty--that flow\\nof fresh and natural melody which we find in Schubert and Haydn.\" Dr.\\nHanslick recommends the score as a model to students of instrumentation.\\n\\n[Illustration: Henry T.
